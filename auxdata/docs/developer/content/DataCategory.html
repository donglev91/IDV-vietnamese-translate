[header {Data categories}]


This represents a hierarchical category of string names 
and is used to categorize  different flavors of data within
DataChoice objects and for determining what displays are applicable
to what data. A DataCategory object really represents a 
node in a list of DataCategory objects that define the hierarchy.
For example, the string FOO-BAR-ZOO
is represented by three DataCategory objects:

<pre>
 +-----+     +-----+     +-----+
 | FOO |-->  | BAR | --> | ZOO |
 +-----+     +-----+     +-----+
 </pre>

There are static utility methods for parsing a string category name
into a chain of objects. Likewise there are methods for parsing
a String of semi-colon delimited category strings  into a Collection
of DataCategory chains.

<p>
Category names can also hold regular expressions,e.g., "*", "+" and "."
that gives us alot of flexibility in creating categories that match a variety
of flavors of data.






<p>
The categories  field is a semi-colon (";") delimited set of
data category strings. Each data category specification
is a dash ("-") delimited set of category components. So a data category
can be viewed  as a hierarchy or path of components. 
For example, you could have a  categories entry:
<pre>textdisplay.categories = text;html</pre>


This says that the <code>textdisplay</code> DisplayControl is applicable
to any data which has data category of <code>text</code> or <code>html</code>.
Now lets suppose we know there is data available that is html but has a more
complex categorization, perhaps html that is weather related e.g.:
<pre>html.weather</pre>

In this case we might have a specialized display control that knows how 
to deal with these <code>html-weather</code> categorized data. In this case 
we would have a data category like:
<pre>special_html_display.categories= html-weather</pre>

This special category would only be applicable to the special "html-weather" data.
However, this data is still "html" like data and we would also want the <code>textdisplay</code>
DisplayControl to be able to display this data. To do this we can take advantage
of the regular  expression capability of data categories. Each component of a data
category can also be a regular expression. So we could change the category
of the <code>textdisplay</code> to be:

<pre>textdisplay.categories = *-text-*;*-html-*</pre> 

This states that the  <code>textdisplay</code> is applicable to any data 
that has a category that contains "text" as a component.  This can be read
as: 0 or more (arbitrary) components followed by a "text" component followed by 0 or more 
(arbitrary)  components.

<br>

Another example:
<pre>2D-TIME-*</pre>
is read as any category  that  begins with the components "2D" and "TIME" and ends
with 0 or more components.

<br>
We can also use the "+" to represent 1 or more and the "." to represent one, e.g.:
<pre>
2D-TIME-+ (2D-TIME followed by one or more components)
2D-TIME-. (2D-TIME followed by one component)
2D-TIME-.-FOO (2D-TIME followed by one component followed by FOO)
</pre>

One could also use richer regular expressions here but it has not been thouroughly tested
(and needed) yet. Note: currently a string representation of a category is parsed
(in <a href=../data/DataCategory.html>DataCategory</a>) using a StringTokenizer,
breaking on "-". So if you use a regular expression that contains a "-" (e.g., \[A-Z]+),
this will break. Sometime in the future we'll tokenize smarter to allow for
escapes, e.g.: \[A\-Z]+.
