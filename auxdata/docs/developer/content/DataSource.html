[ht::head {Data sources}]


The [dg::class ucar.unidata.data.DataSource] interface 
defines the  api through which 
all data sources are accessed. There is a base class 
[dg::class ucar.unidata.data.DataSourceImpl]
that provides a set of base services. There are a variety of
DataSource implementations:

<ul>
  <li>[dg::className ucar.unidata.data.DataSourceImpl]
  <ul>
    <li>[dg::className ucar.unidata.data.grid.GridDataSource]
    <ul>
      <li>[dg::className ucar.unidata.data.grid.GeoGridDataSource]
      <ul>
        <li>[dg::className ucar.unidata.data.grid.DodsGeoGridDataSource]
      </ul>
      <li>[dg::className ucar.unidata.data.grid.Vis5DDataSource]
    </ul>
    <li>[dg::className ucar.unidata.data.imagery.ImageDataSource]
    <ul>
      <li>[dg::className ucar.unidata.data.imagery.AddeImageDataSource], 	
	  [dg::className ucar.unidata.data.imagery.McIDASImageDataSource]
    </ul>
    <li>[dg::className ucar.unidata.data.point.AddePointDataSource], 
        [dg::className ucar.unidata.data.point.NetcdfMetarDataSource], 
	[dg::className ucar.unidata.data.sounding.RaobDataSource], 
	[dg::className ucar.unidata.data.sounding.TrackDataSource],
	[dg::className ucar.unidata.data.text.TextDataSource], 
	[dg::className ucar.unidata.data.text.AddeTextDataSource]
  </ul>
</ul>



<H2>Creating data sources</H2>
The IDV uses the [dg::class ucar.undiata.data.DataManager] class to create and 
manage the set of DataSource-s.
This singleton object can be accessed by the 
<code>IntegratedDataView.getDataManager</code> method.

<p>
The DataManager knows nothing about the specific DataSource classes. 
Rather, the set of available DataSource-s is  defined within  the 
<a href=../datasource.xml>datasource.xml</a> resource file.
<p>
This file has the form:
[ht::pre {
<datasource 
       id="EXAMPLE.DATA" 
       factory="ucar.unidata.apps.example.ExampleDataSource" 
       patterns="\.txt$,\.html$"
       label="Example data source"/>
   ...
}]
The DataManager parses the xml and creates a set of 
[dg::class ucar.unidata.data.DataSourceDescriptor]
objects which hold this information.
<p>
The <i>patterns</i> attribute is a  set of 
comma separated regular expression patterns 
used to determine if this data source is applicable for a given file or url.
For example, from the main IDV 
[dg::class ucar/unidata/idv/resources/datasource.xml] file we have the
entry for the GeoGridDataSource:

[ht::pre {<datasource id="FILE.NETCDF" 
               factory="ucar.unidata.data.grid.GeoGridDataSource" 
               patterns=".nc$,.cdf$"
               label="Netcdf files">
}]


This data source type is applicable to anything that ends with .nc of .cdf
(The \$ used in the patterns represents the end of line character
in a regular expression.). 
The patterns are also used to instantiate a set of PatternFileFilters
used when choosing files from the file system.
<p>

The factory attribute in the  xml 
is the name of the class that implements ucar.unidata.data.DataSourceFactory.
This is the class that is instantiated for a particular data source. The DataManager
then asks this class to <code>getDataSource</code>. We do this so we could
separate out the class that creates a DataSource form the actual DataSource.
In practice however, the DataSourceImpl class implements this interface
by simply returning itself. i.e., the factory that is created is the actual
DataSource.

<p>
The important DataManager methods include:
[ht::codep DataSource createDataSource (String dataName)]

Here dataName is typically either a url or a file. The DataManager find the data source
entry that which contains a pattern that matches the given dataName. It then 
turns around and calls createDataSource, as described below, passing in the dataName,
dataType (i.e., the id from the xml), and an empty properties table.

[ht::codep DataSource createDataSource (Object dataName, String dataType, Hashtable properties)]

This method can get called directly by data choosers and the IDV. Here dataName
can be anything (a url, a filename, a complex data structure). The argument dataType
is an <i>id</i> within the datasource.xml file. The properties table
allows one to pass in extra information when creating a DataSource.
<p>
The DataManager first sees if a DataSource with the given dataName object
already exists in its list of created DataSource-s. If it does exists
then that previously created DataSource is returned. 
If not, the DataManager looks up the DataSourceFactory class to 
instantiate from 
datasource.xml. The DataManager then tries to find and call a constructor
on this factory class with the following signature:

[ht::codep (DataSourceDescriptor.class, dataName.getClass(), Hashtable.class);]


<h2>ExampleDataSource.java</h2>
So, you're probably wondering how you can create your own DataSource.
There is an example implementation in this package: 
<a href=../ExampleDataSource.java>ExampleDataSource.java</a>.

This class derives from DataSourceImpl and needs
to implement  just 3 methods: 
the constructor, doMakeDataChoices and getDataInner.
<p>

This class also has to be registered with the IDV so that when some 
file or other data source on a network has been selected the IDV 
knows what DataSource to create. You do this by adding an entry 
into a <a href=../datasource.xml>datasource.xml</a>:
[ht::pre {
<datasource id="EXAMPLE.DATA" 
            factory="ucar.unidata.apps.example.ExampleDataSource" 
            patterns="\.txt$,\.html$"
            label="Example data"/>
}]

This could be the core IDV resource file 
(located in [dg::class ucar/unidata/idv/resources/datasource.xml])
or in a different file that is included as a resource in your 
application (like the example 
[dg::class ucar/unidata/apps/example/datasource.xml]).
To include  your own file in an application see 
<a href=resources.html>resources.html</a>.


<p>
<h3>Creating DataChoice-s</h3>
The DirectDataChoice's ctor signature looks like:
<pre>
DirectDataChoice (DataSource dataSource, 
                  Object id,  
                  String name, 
                  String description, 
                  List categories,  
                  DataSelection dataSelection);
</pre>
Where:<br>
dataSource is this object.
<br>
id can be anything, a field name, a data structure that identifies some data, etc.
<br>
The name is the short name and the description is the long description used.
<br>
categories  is a list  of ucar.unidata.data.DataCategory objects that represent the
categories of data that this DataChoice represents.  
See <a href=datacategory.html>datacategory.html </a> for more information.
<br>
The dataSelection (which can be null) allows you to define a set of times for this DataChoice.
<p>
So you can do: <pre>
Object someIdForField1 = "field1";
List categories = DataCategory.parseCategories ("2D grid;GRID-2D-TIME;");
DataChoice dc = 
  new DirectDataChoice (this, 
                        someIdForField1, 
                        "Field 1", 
                        "Some desc", categories, 
                         null);
addDataChoice (dc);
</pre>
