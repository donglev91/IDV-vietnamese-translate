[header {Bundles and Persistence}]

The IDV can save off the state of the application
using   the [dg::class ucar.unidata.xml.XmlEncoder]
class.  This class  supports the serialization/de-serialization of
objects from/to xml.  We use the term "bundle" to refer to
the saved application state.
<p>
When the IDV saves off a "bundle" it saves off all of the current
data sources, displays and the state of the various 2D and 3D views.
The actual object that is saved off is a Hashtable, e.g.:

<pre>
Hashtable data= new Hashtable ();
data.put (ID_DATASOURCES, sources);
data.put (ID_DISPLAYCONTROLS, displayControls);
data.put (ID_VIEWMANAGERS, viewManagers);
</pre>

If an application needs to add their own state into a bundle the methods:

<pre>
protected void addToBundle (Hashtable data) throws Exception {}
protected void instantiateFromBundle  (Hashtable ht) throws Exception {}
</pre>

can be overwritten. Make sure you call the super class method if you overwrite
these methods (or nothing will get saved).


<h2>XmlEncoder</h2>
The XmlEncoder class is used to save off and recreate bundles.
It uses reflection on the object
to write out an object tag and a set of property or method tags
that define the persisted state of the object.

<p>
To encode/decode an object to/from xml there are certain requirements on the object's
class. With just a vanilla class the class must have a parameter-less constructor.
Any properties that are to be saved/restored must have associated public get and 
set methods:

<pre>
public void setSomeProperty (type value)
public type getSomeProperty ()
</pre>

If the class you want to persist does not have a parameterless constructor
and/or you want to intervene somehow in the encoding/decoding process there 
are a variety of ways to accomplish this using
<a href=#XmlPersistable>XmlPersistable</a>,
<a href=#XmlObjectFactory>XmlObjectFactory</a>,
or 
<a href=#XmlDelegate>XmlDelegate</a>.



<p>
Running [dg::class2 ucar.unidata.xml.XmlEncoder]
standalone (i.e., java ucar.unidata.xml.XmlEncoder) will run a test. 
Providing any command line argument
will result in the test xml being printed out to stderr.
<p>
The relevant methods are:<br>
[method XmlEncoder.toXml(Object object)]<br>
[method XmlEncoder.toObject (String xml)]
<p>
For example, the result of: 

<pre>
String s = "just a test";
XmlEncoder encoder = new XmlEncoder ();
String xml = encoder.toXml (s);
</pre>

Will be  the xml: 
[pre {<string>just a test</string>}]

Now  calling:

<pre>Object result = encoder.toObject (xml);
System.err.println (result.toString ());</pre>

Will result in the  String "just a test"
<p>

The following:
<pre>
public class Test {
   int x;
   public Test () {x=5;}
   public int getX () {return x;}
   public void setX (int x) {this.x =x;}
}
String xml = (new XmlEncoder()).toXml (new Test ());
</pre>
will result in:
[pre {
<object class="Test">
   <property name="x">
      <int>5</int>
   </property>
</object>
}]

We do special handling for List and Hashtable.
In these cases we write out a set of <i>method</i>
tags. e.g. for an ArrayList  of Strings we do:
[pre {
<object class="java.util.ArrayList">
   <method name="add">
       <string>Foo</string>
    </method>
   <method name="add">
      <string>Bar</string>
    </method>
</object>
</pre>}]


<h2>Modifying general XmlEncoder functionality</h2>
There are a variety of ways to modify how objects are encoded/decoded.


<a name=XmlPersistable>
<p><b>[dg::class ucar.unidata.xml.XmlPersistable]</b><br>
</a>
If the object that is being encoded implements XmlPersistable the encoder 
will defer to it both when persisting the object and when re-instantiating the
object. See [dg::class ucar.unidata.xml.test.Test2] for an example.

<a name=XmlDelegate>
<p><b>[dg::class ucar.unidata.xml.XmlDelegate]</b><br>
</a>
Second, you can define an XmlDelegate object that handles objects
of a certain class:
<code><pre>encoder.addDelegateForClass (theClassToHandle, theXmlDelegate);</pre></code>
See [dg::class ucar.unidata.xml.test.Test] for an example.


<a name=XmlObjectFactory>
<p><b>[dg::class ucar.unidata.xml.XmlObjectFactory]</b><br>
</a>
Normally the encoding results in a set of nested object
tags that contain method and property tags. You can also
write out a factory tag that specifies a factory class, which implements
the XmlObjectFactory interface. e.g:

[pre {<factory class="Test2Factory">
     ...anything here
</factory>
}]

In this case the factory is instantiated but the actual object used
is a result of:
<code><pre>Object = factory.getObject (encoder, xml Element);</pre></code>

<p><b>Constructor tags</b><br>
Normally, the encoder instantiates an object through reflection
using the "bean" (i.e., parameter-less) constructor. For  objects that do not
have the bean constructor this presents a problem. To resolve this
a constructor tag is looked for under the object tag. If found the correct
construcor is found for the given class (using the types of the sub-components
of the constructor tag. e.g., for Test2 we do:
[pre {
      <object class="ucar.unidata.xml.Test2">
            <constructor>
              <int>myX</int>
            </constructor>
       </object>
}]


<h2>Modifying XmlEncoder for an IDV application </h2>
The IDV creates its XmlEncoder with the method getEncoder.
In this method the encoder is initialized with a call to:

<pre>protected void initEncoder (XmlEncoder encoder) {}</pre>

You can overwrite this method to initialized  the encoder for any particular
classes you need to have persisted.
<p>
To initialize the encoder the IDV calls the static method<br> 
[method  VisADPersistence.init (encoder);] 
<br>
which is a method on the [dg::class ucar.visad.VisADPersistence] class.
This method uses the XmlDelegate method coupled with  the constructor tag
to define how to persist off the Visad objects encountered within the IDV.
