[header {Starting the IDV/Using JNLP files}]


The end user typically brings up an IDV application 
through  Webstart using a jnlp file. We have an example
jnlp file here: <a href=example.jnlp>example.jnlp</a>. (Of course
if you click on this link and have Webstart installed you will launch
the ExampleIdv application).

<p>
The jnlp file contains
references to a server repository of java jar files,
a reference to the main application class and a set of 
command line arguments to pass to the application. 
The example.jnlp file has a single command line argument:

<pre>-properties /ucar/unidata/apps/example/example.properties</pre>

which is used to overwrite and/or add properties to the IDV application.
This particular property file is stored internally in the jar file, 
however, it can also be a url (or  a reference to your local file system).
For further information about command line arguments see 
<a href=commandline.html> commandline.html</a>.

<p>
As mentioned above you do not necessarily need to create your own
application class. You can configure the behavior of the IDV through property
and resource files.
