[header {Usage Overview}]

The starting point of the IDV application (i.e., the main) is
an application specific class derived
from [dg::class ucar.unidata.idv.IntegratedDataViewer]. For example,
in our example application the main class is
[dg::class ucar.unidata.apps.example.ExampleIdv].
In the reference application  the class is
[dg::class ucar.unidata.idv.DefaultIdv].

<p>

<h3>Initialization</h3>
When the IDV starts up  a singleton instance of this  
main class is created and the init is called.
The application is configured by first defining a set of
property files in the code. See for example, 
[dg::className ucar.unidata.apps.example.ExampleIdv {initPropertyFiles(String[])}].
For more on property files see <a href="resources/Properties.html">here</a>.
For more on how we define the location of property files and resource files
see <a href="resources/index.html#paths">here</a>.

<p>

The IDV then processes its 
<a href="CommandLine.html">command line arguments</a> using
the [dg::className ucar.unidata.idv.ArgsManager] class.
Among other things, these arguments may specify
other property files (using -properties) and/or 
specific properties (using -Dname=value) that override the
system property files.

<p>

Once all of the command line arguments are parsed the idv loads in the 
initial property files, any property files defined in those files 
(by the <i>application.properties</i> property) and any of the command
line properties.

<p>
Among other things, the property file defines a set of resource bundle files 
(<i>.rbi</i>) 
with the <i>application.resourcefiles</i> property. These are xml files that 
define where the IDV can find various resources (typically xml, text and bundle files)


<h3>Creating the GUI</h3>
The IDV then creates the default window with a call to
the <code>initGui</code> method in 
[dg::class ucar.unidata.idv.ui.IdvUIManager {initGui()}].
This creates the default user interface. This method will create 
the gui using a <i>skin.xml</i> resource or, if none found, 
with a call to  the method
[dg::className ucar.unidata.idv.ui.IdvUIManager {doMakeDefaultContents(IdvWindow,ViewManager)}]



<h3>The User</h3>

So now all of the initialization is done and the user can begin using the application.

<p>
Usually, the  user first needs to choose  and load in sources of data.
They do this with the <a href="Choosers.html">data choosers</a>.  
This data source can be a file on the file system, a  
url  (e.g., dods url, adde url), or a server specific data structure. 
The IDV takes this specification of the source of data and, using some 
descriptions in the  <a href="resources/index.html">data source descriptor resources</a>, 
instantiates an object that implements the [dg::class ucar.unidata.data.DataSource] 
interface (see <a href="Datasource.html">Datasource.html</a>).  
For example, we have:<br>

[dg::class ucar.unidata.data.grid.GeoGridDataSource] that handles
gridded Netcdf files, 
<br>

[dg::class ucar.unidata.data.imagery.AddeImageDataSource] that handles
Adde images and <br>

[dg::class ucar.unidata.data.text.TextDataSource] that handles urls pointing
to html or text files.

<p>

The set of fields or other specific  data that a DataSource 
holds (e.g., temperature field, a sounding  at  a station, a html page, etc.) 
are defined using the [dg::class ucar.unidata.data.DataChoice] class
and its derived classes: [dg::class ucar.unidata.data.DirectDataChoice]
and [dg::class ucar.unidata.data.CompositeDataChoice].

<p>
A DataChoice may represent anything: 
a field in a gridded netcdf file, a sounding, a time step in an image 
sequence, etc. The interpretation of the DataChoice is left to the DataSource.
A DataChoice has a name, an object identifier (used by the the DataSource),
and a list of <a href=datacategory.html>DataCategories</a>. A 
[dg::class ucar.unidata.data.DataCategory]
is an object that holds 
a hierarchy of String names (e.g., GRID-2D-TIME). It is used to 
display the DataChoice in a GUI and to match up DataChoice-s with 
DisplayControls that are applicable.

<p>
When the DataSource creates its initial list of DataChoice-s this
list is then processed by the [dg::class ucar.unidata.data.DerivedDataDescriptor]
to have a set of  
[dg::class ucar.unidata.data.DerivedDataChoice]-s added to it.
These DerivedDataChoice-s are used to create new fields based
on existing fields. For example, if a gridded data set has a 
temperature (T) and a relative humidity (RH) data choice a 
DerivedDataChoice will automagically get created that
provides dewpoint.

<p>
The IDV  then adds  the DataSource and its list of DataChoices into
any of the [dg::class ucar.unidata.idv.DataTree] (the JTree  GUI) or 
menus in the gui.
The user can then select a DataChoice to create a display with, or as 
they are known <a href=displays.html>DisplayControl</a>-s.
This selection can be a right mouse click in the DataTree or a double click.
If a double click then a [dg::class ucar.unidata.idv.DataControlDialog] is
shown that list the applicable  displays and also a set of times (if the selected
DataChoice holds any times.
If the user selects

The IDV keeps around a list of  [dg::class ucar.unidata.idv.ControlDescriptor]-s 
that it creates from
the [dg::class ucar/unidata/idv/resources/controls.xml] resource files. 
The ControlDescriptors that are applicable
to the particular chosen DataChoice (using the DataCategory-s) are shown and
the user can select one.

<p>

The DisplayControl is created. If it needs to place its displayable (e.g., contour, 
cross section, etc.) into a common window (e.g., the main 3d window) it calls
its [dg::className ucar.unidata.idv.ControlContext] to find a ViewManager.

<p>

Finally, the user may save off the current state of the application 
using the <a href="Persistence.html">persistence</a> mechansim.
