[header {Property files}]

Much of the functionality  of the IDV is defined through its
property file (or files) and a set of xml based resource files.
The starting point is the property file (of which we have an example:
<a href=../example.properties> example.properties</a>.

<p>
The IDV will first process its own default properties file. It will then 
process each of the ones defined on the command line. In this way 
any subsequent properties override previous  properties.

<p>
Another way to define your own application properties is to overwrite the
method:<pre>
public void initPropertyFiles (List files) {
   files.add ("/ucar/unidata/apps/example/example.properties");
}
</pre>
in your application class (e.g., ExampleIdv).


<p>
The property file allows you to specify some basic user interface
properties (e.g.,title). However, the most important aspect  is the
ability to specify a set of resources, <a href=resources.html> describe here</a>.
