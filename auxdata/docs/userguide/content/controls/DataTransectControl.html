{Data Transect Control}

{
The data transect control is used to adjust data transect 
displays. The control window includes a display of the profile of the
data along the transect.  The vertical axis is the parameter value
and the horizontal axis is the distance along the cross section.
In the main window, a transect selector allows you to position
the location of the transect by dragging the selector points along
the line.
<p>
The control window consists of two tabs. The first shows the
the profile of the
data along the transect:

The second contains widgets for changing properties of
that display:
