{Grid Trajectory Control}

{
The grid trajectory control is used to control displays of 2D and 3D gridded trajectory data. After the creation of a 2D
or 3D trajectory, a TrackControl panel is appended to this control.

{{Points} {
This is an option for the initializing the trajectory initial area. When the control is first created, it is the default
option. Every time the user left-clicks on the view window, a marker is placed to mark a initial point. After the trajectory
is created, the default is unchecked and the user needs to specify one of the options for next initialization. When the
user changes the initial option, the display of the initial area and the trajectory on the view window will be removed.
}}

{{ClosePolygon} {
This is an option for the initializing the initial trajectory area. When this option is selected, click and hold the
left mouse button and draw a polygon in the view window.
}}

{{Rectangle} {
This is an option for the initializing the initial trajectory area.  When this option is selected, click and hold the
left mouse button and drag a rectangle in the view window.

{{Skip Factor} {To avoid cluttering the display you can define the number of grid points that are skipped with the
Skip Factor combo box. A skip interval of 0 mean show all grid values, 1 means skip every other one, 2 means
show every third one, etc. A skip factor can only be applied to a close polygon initial area. }}

{{Backward trajectory} {This is an option to create a backward trajectory. The initial area specifies where
trajectories end at the last time step.}}

{{Create Trajectory} {
After selecting the level and specifying the initial area, click on the button Create Trajectory to create the display.
