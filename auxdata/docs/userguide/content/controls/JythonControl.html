{Jython Control}

{
The Jython Control allows for the development of custom display controls
written in Jython. It operates in two modes. 
<p>
First,  is the &quot;developer&quot; mode. 
Here the developer can create a Jython Control, specify
the name of the display, any data categories,
the probe type and write the Jython that creates a GUI and responds
to data, animation time and probe position changes.

<p>
The default Jython  code has examples of accessing data, etc.

<p>
The second mode is &quot;user&quot; mode. In developer mode you
can write out an specification of the Jython Control to a plugin
through the [ug::menu File Save {Write to Plugin}] menu.
This plugin, when loaded, will only show the user interface that
is created by the developer written Jython.
