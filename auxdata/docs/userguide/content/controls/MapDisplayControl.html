{Map  Control}

{

Maps in the IDV are shown using the Map display control. There are
two ways this control is used: as  the default  background maps and
as a user created map display.  The control window is composed of
two tabs. The first lists the set of available maps:

The second allows the user to control the display of the
latitude/longitude lines and labels:

New maps may be added through the [ug::menu Edit] menu. You can
choose to add any of the predefined maps available to the IDV or
you can select a map file (e.g., a shape file)  from the file system.

<p>

The  [ug::menu File {Default Maps} {Save  as the Default Map Preference}] 
menu item  allows you to save the current set of maps
in a display as the default maps. When a new view window is created
the maps that are saved as the default are used as the background
maps.

<p><b>Note:</b> Once you save a set of maps as the default maps
then every time your create a new display those maps and those maps
only will be used.  If you were to add a set of new maps using a
plugin then those maps will not show up by default in your display.

<p>

To clear the default maps, choose the menu item 
[ug::menu File {Default Maps} {Remove Local Map Defaults}].

}


{{Maps} {

This list shows the set of currently loaded maps. In this list you
can remove a map, change its visibility, line width, style and
color. The [ug::button Fast Rendering] button, when on, can save
on rendering time by not checking for projection seam crossings.
Note: some maps will display incorrectly when fast rendering is
turned on.  The &quot;plus&quot; icon on the right allows you to
add the given map as a Map Data Source. This allows you to do display
the given map in 3D draped over topography and/or do spatial analysis
using the map (e.g., grid averages within a map).

<p>

The link button, when set to linked, will apply any change to a particular map
(e.g., color, line width) to all visible maps.

}}


{ {Latitude/Longitude Lines} {

These controls allow you to display latitude and longitude lines.
You can set the visibility, interval, base value, line width, line 
style and color.

<p>

The link button, when set to linked, will apply any changes to a
latitude or longitude line to the other line.

}}

{ {Latitude/Longitude Labels} {

These controls allow you to display latitude and longitude labels.
You can set the visibility, interval, base value, label locations, 
color, alignment, font and format.

<p>

The labels will be spaced out based on the interval and relative
to (base) values.  For example, if you have an interval of 15 and
a base of 0, the labels will be
...-30,&nbsp;-15,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;15,&nbsp;30...  If the base it 5,
the labels will be
...-25,&nbsp;-10,&nbsp;5,&nbsp;20,&nbsp;35...

<p>

The [ug::button {At XXX}] options let the user select which lines the labels
are placed at.  The [ug::button Alignment] option lets the user select the 
positioning of the label relative to the point being labeled.  It is based
on a compass notation where NW would be positioned up and to the left of
the point, N would be above the point, etc:

<pre>
                    NW     N     NE

                     W   Middle  E

                    SW     S     SE
</pre>
        
<p>
The [ug::button Font] selector allows you to set the Font name, style and size 
of the labels.

<p>

The [ug::button Format] selector allows you to set the format for the labels.
The acceptable characters are DD (degrees), MM (minutes), SS
(seconds), H (hemisphere - N,S,E,W), and one or more of d (decimal
degrees), m (decimal minutes), s (decimal seconds).  The [ug::button {0-360}]
checkbox will format longitude labels using 0-360 notation instead
of -180 to 180.  Examples:

<pre>
                    DDH          -&gt;    34N, 43S
                    DD:MM:SS     -&gt;    -67:45:33
                    DD.dd        -&gt;    45.05, -117.34
                    DD MM" SS'H  -&gt;    67 45" 33'W
</pre>

<p>
The link button, when set to linked, will apply any changes to one set of
latitude or longitude labels to the other labels.

{ {Position} {

This slider  allows you to  set the vertical position of the maps
and latitude/longitude lines and labels.
