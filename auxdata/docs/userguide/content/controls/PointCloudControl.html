{Point Cloud Control}

The Point Cloud control displays point data as a set of colored points.  It is more efficient than the Point Data Plot control for showing
the locations of a large number (e.g. millions) of points.  It does not do automatic spatial decluttering, but you can subset by data value
and drawing a clip region. The control window contains three tabs. The first shows the point cloud control

The second shows the clipping control, it is a simplify version of draw control
