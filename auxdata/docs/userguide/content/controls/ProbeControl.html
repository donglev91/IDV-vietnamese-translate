{Data Probe/Time Series}

{
The data probe shows a time series chart of
one or more fields at a 
single location.  It also shows a tabular readout
of the value at the current animation time step.

In the image below we have a Probe Control showing three parameters:
T, RH and windspeed. Their values at the current animation time step
are shown in the table  and their time series are shown.
Note, the T and RH fields are shown in one chart and the
windspeed is shown in another chart. You can have any number of fields
and any number of charts. 
You can configure the layout of the charts, the chart properties
and the line properties for each parameter. See <a href="Chart.html">here</a>
for more information.


[ht::cimg images/ProbeControlGui.gif]

A small colored square Selector Point
in the main IDV display shows where the probe is located.
You can drag the probe point over the map in the main display.
You can change the probe point vertically as well.



The table shows the  parameters with  their values, the level
at which the value is sampled, and the type of sampling.
The location of the probe is shown, in latitude, longitude, and altitude.  
When surface data is probed the height of the probe point does not matter.


You can add new parameters a number of ways:
<ul>
<li> Right click on the table  and select [ht::menu {Add Parameter...}]
<li> Through the  [ug::menu Edit {Add Parameter...}] menu.
<li> Through the  [ug::menu View Parameters {Add Parameter...}] menu.
</ul>


Each parameter has a set of actions that can be applied:

<ul>
<li> [ug::menu {Copy}]. Copy the selected parameter. This allows
you view the same parameter value at different locations or
with different sampling methods.
<li> [ug::menu {Chart Properties}]. Allows you to change how the parameter is displayed in the chart. 
See <a href="Chart.html">here</a>
<li> [ug::menu {Change Unit}]. You can change the display unit for the selected parameter.
<li> [ug::menu {Set Sound...}]. You can define a sound type and range for the parameter. As the probe is moved around
or the time animation is run a sound is applied based on the value.
<li> [ug::menu {Remove}]. Remove the selected parameter.
<li> [ug::menu {Displays}]. You can directly create  new display using the selected parameter.
</ul>

These parameter actions can be accessed  by right clicking on the parameter row in the table
or through the [ug::menu View Parameters] menu.


<p>
<b>Probing on point data</b><br>
You can also probe on point data as well. The only difference is that this control will 
find the closest observation to the probe position and use that data to sample on.

}

{{Other Menu Items} {
<ul> 
<li> [ug::menu File Save {Export Current Time as CSV}]
and
[ug::menu File Save {Export All  Times as CSV}] allows you to export the current time step's
data or all times as a comma separated file (CSV).

<li> Selecting the [ug::menu Edit {Change Display Format}] allows you to change
how the data is displayed in the table. This template is html with
macros that get replaced with the display value, unit, raw value and raw data unit.

<li> [ug::menu Edit {Add Parameter...}] Add a new parameter to the list.


<li> The [ug::menu View Probe Position] menu allows you to
reset the probe position and  fix  the x, y or z axis of movement.
Resetting the probe position is useful when the probe point
gets lost in the displays.

<li> The [ug::menu View Probe Size] menu allows you to
increase and decrease the probe size.


<li> The [ug::menu View Probe {Probe Shape}] menu allows you to
change the shape of the probe.



</ul>

{{Location} {
These fields display the location of the probe and allow the user
to directly set the location. Enter a latitude, longitude or altitude
and press return.
}}


{{Levels} {
The [ht::command Level] column in the table shows the height of the sample
point. Click in the level value box, and you can reset the level
for that parameter to other altitude values 
(in the native data set) with a selector list
of levels that pops up. The level "Probe's" is whatever level the probe happens
to be at, which may not be a native level of the data.
Note that once you set the level to a level not at the probe point, the
probe point no longer shows where the sample is from. The probe does 
have the same latitude and longitude as the data shown, but not the altitude.
}}


{{Sampling} {
Probe values can be  interpolated from neighboring grid values, 
since the probe position almost never coincides exactly with the location
 of a data point. The [ht::command Sampling] column shows if this interpolation is
used. "Weighed average" uses interpolation of nearby data points; 
"Nearest neighbor" gives the exact value of the datum in the grid cell where
the probe is located .Click in the sampling column box, and you can 
set the sampling method for that parameter.}}
