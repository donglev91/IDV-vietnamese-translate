{Radar RHI Control}

{
The radar RHI(range-height indicator) display, in the form of a vertical cross-section,
appears in the main 3D window and as a 2D plot in its display control. The control window
contains two tabs. The first shows the RHI in 2D:

{{Vertical Scale} {You can change the vertical scale of the 2D cross section view.
The Auto-scale checkbox, when checked, will scale the Y-AXis of cross section to the
sampled data range.}}

{{Azimuth} {This lists all the azimuth angles in the RHI dataset.
Selecting the azimuth in the list shows the corresponding RHI display}}
