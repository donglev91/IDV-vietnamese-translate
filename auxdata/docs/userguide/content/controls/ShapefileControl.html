{Shapefile  Control}

{

The IDV supports the ability to load and display GIS shapefiles. You can select
and load a shape file (i.e., a file that ends with .shp) from the file chooser.
The zipped (.zip) version of shapefiles can also be loaded.

For shape files that also have a data base file (.dbf) 
you can control what shape segments are shown with the [ug::tab Filters] tab.
For a further description see <a href="StationModelControl.htl#filters">here</a>.
<p>
Note: The IDV supports a simple XML format for maps. The Shapefile Control can export
the displayed shapes in this XML format the [ug::menu File Save {Export Displayed Shapes...}] menu.

When the shape file has an associated  data base file (.dbf) 
a tabular listing of the attributes is shown in the [ug::tab Table]
tab.
Use the [ug::button Select Fields to Show] button to select what fields to show.
The table can be exported as a CSV file with the [ug::menu File Save {Export Table...}] menu.
