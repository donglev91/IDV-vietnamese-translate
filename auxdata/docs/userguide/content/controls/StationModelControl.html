{Point Data Plot}

{
The Point Data Plot Control shows a set of observations using 
a layout model. The control window consists of four tabs. The first
tab allows you to control basics of the display:

[ht::cimg images/StationModelControlGui1.gif]

The second tab allows you to change the observation times that are shown in the
display.  By default, data for a single time corresponding to the current
animation time will be shown.  Using this widget allows you to show multiple
times at once.

The third tab provides a time series chart and a data readout table of a selected station.
To use this simply click on a station in the main display.
Use the [ug::button Select Fields] button to show a dialog
that allows you to select what fields are displayed in the table.
Double click or right click on a table row to add it to the time
series chart.
See <a href="Chart.html">here</a> for more information about customizing the chart.

The [ug::menu File {Save} {Save Plot Preferences}] menu item allows you to save the current
set of selected fields and their chart line  properties as the default
to use for all future point data plots.

The [ug::menu View {Show Raw Data}] menu  controls whether
the data in the table is formatted or show as raw data.
The [ug::menu File {Export Table}] menu item allows you to export
the table as a comma separated value (CSV) file.

The fourth tab allows you to specify a set of visibility filters.
See below for  further discussion on this.
}

{{Declutter} {Click on the [ht::command Declutter] checkbox to see all locations or 
stations. The display otherwise shows only selected stations that do
not overlap. When decluttering is turned on then, as you navigate through the
display (e.g., through zooming) then the decluttering will be  progressively
applied. The small &quot;lock&quot; icon allows you to lock the stations that
are currently being displayed and not have their display changed when
navigating.
}}

{{Plot Density} {
This slider allows you to change how dense the display of stations is when decluttering.
}}


{{Layout Model} {
The [ht::command {Layout model}], 
the choice of data and layout design for data display at each
station,  in use is named. Click on [ht::command Change] to select other
previously-defined station models, either provided by the IDV or defined by users.


You can change the station model (plot layout), and
create new station models, with the
<a href="../tools/StationModelEditor.html">Layout Model Editor</a>
}}


{{Scale} {
You can scale up or down the size of the displayed elements with this field.
}}

{{Vertical Position} {
You can choose to display the locations at their altitude (if there is one)
or you can override this and specifically define the vertical position.
}}

{{Show (Time)} {
Select either individual times or multiple times.
}}

{{Range (Time)} {
Select the <img src="images/calendar_edit.png"> button to show the 
dialog to change the start and end of the time range that is
used for displaying data:

[ht::cimg images/TrackControlTimeSettings.gif]

This can be used with the individual or multiple times option.  
This dialog  allows you to define the time range of the observations to
show. The image above defines that the end time is the current animation time. 
The start time is relative to the end time less 30 minutes.
<p>
This time setting is similar to that used for the general 
<a href="../ui/Animation.html#animationset">time animation</a>.
}}

{{Declutter (Time)} {
This field allows you to subset the data that is being displayed  
by only showing every N minutes. For normal observation data 
(e.g., station data) this field is not needed. However, for 
observation data that contains many times (e.g., airplane track data)
you can use this field to subset the times.
<p>
Note:  If you are displaying point data that has a large number of times
you will be prompted whether you want to view all of the times. If Yes then
this is automatically set.
<p>
For most of the point data sources you can specify a time binning through
the data source properties.
}}

{{Filters} {
<a name="filters"></a>
The Point Data Plot Control provides the ability to define a set of filters 
to show or hide particular observations based  on the values they hold.

[ht::cimg images/StationModelControlFilters.gif] 

The above image shows the tab with which you define filters.
This image shows two filter expressions, one that states the 
<i>T</i> field needs to be greater that 70 F, the other
states that the <i>SPD</i> value needs to be greater than
10.  The unit of the value you enter (e.g., F) is defined with:<pre>
\\\[unit_name\\\]
</pre>
If you do not provide a unit then the comparison is done using the native unit
of the observation value.
<p>
You can define any number of expressions, define whether they all should
be matched or any should be matched, and disable and enable the filter.
<p>
You can also disable the filters and specify whether all filters
need to match or any of the filters need to match.
