{Isosurface  Control}

{


Isosurfaces  can be made in two types of displays, regular
isosurfaces, and isosurfaces colored by another field.
An isosurface is a 3D surface mapping the location of 
 a single parameter value through a 3D field.
Isosurfaces are a 3D analog of a single 
contour line in a 2D plot; the intersection of an isosurface and
any plane is a contour line of the same value in that plane.

You can 
request an isosurface colored with a range of colors, where colors indicate the values of
another field, not the one used to make the shape of the surface. 
A common use is to color isosurfaces by height (geopotential
height in some grid output) to show height of features above the
surface by color.
