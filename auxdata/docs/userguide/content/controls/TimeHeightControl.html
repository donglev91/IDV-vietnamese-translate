{Time-Height Control}

{
A time-height display
is a display of samples of a 3D parameter along a vertical
profile line from top to bottom of the available data, with time as the
independent coordinate (x axis).
You can choose both a contour time height display and a color shaded
time height display.

The map position of the
vertical profile is indicated by the "Lat: Long:" readout 
above the graph .


The map position of the profile
is shown in the main 3D view window by a colored vertical
line. There is a Selector Point
on top of the vertical line.  
You can move the vertical profile line over the map 
by dragging the Selector Point with the left mouse button.

You can zoom in on the display graph by holding down the
Shift key and dragging the mouse pointer up while pressing the left
mouse button; drag down to zoom out.  You can pan
the graph by holding down the
Ctrl key and dragging the mouse pointer in any direction while
