{Time Series}

{

For 2D data you can make a time series plot of data values at a
location as a function of time with the <b>Time Series</b>.
The map location of the sample is indicated by the &quot;Lat:&quot; and &quot;Lon:&quot; 
readout.

The position of the sample point  is shown in the main 3D display 
window by a colored vertical line. There is a Selector Point  
on top of the vertical line.  You can move the position line
over the map  by dragging the Selector Point with the left mouse button.


You can zoom in on the graph by holding down the
Shift key and dragging the mouse pointer up while pressing the left
mouse button (mouse button one); drag down to zoom out.  You can pan
the graph by holding down the
Ctrl key and dragging the mouse pointer in any direction while 
pressing the left mouse button (mouse button one)
