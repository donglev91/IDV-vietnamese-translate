The WebCam control provides an interface to view collections of
webcam imagery from around the United States. This imagery is 
collected and made available through the Unidata web site. 
<p>
<b>
Note: Since this imagery comes from sites around the internet
at times some webcams may fail or not be available.
</b>

<p>
The user interface is composed of two tabs. 
The second tab lists all available image sets and allows you to choose
which one to view:
[ht::cimg images/ImageMovieControlGui2.gif]
We have categorized the available image sets based on region. You can select
the desired image set in either the tree view on the left or the map view
on the right. The map view can be zoomed, panned and decluttered. 
<p>
When you have selected the desired image set simply press the
[ht::command Load Image Set] button or double click  on the selection.




Once you have selected an image set it will be displayed in the
first tab:
[ht::cimg images/ImageMovieControlGui1.gif]

The  menu in the upper right lists the times available.  The animation
control in the upper left allows you to animate the images.
<p>
The [ht::command Animation Mode] allows you to synchronize the
image set animation with the animation in the main display.
You can have the animation in the control drive the
animation in the main display by choosing 
[ht::command To Main Display] or vice-versa by choosing
[ht::command From Main Display].
