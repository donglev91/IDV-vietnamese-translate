The Multi-Display Holder can hold a group of other display controls,
3D views, field selectors, etc. 
<p>
This display behaves a little differently from other displays. It is not
a part of a 3D view and the IDV can run with just one of these displays without
any other windows (i.e., normally when the last main window is closed the IDV
will exit).
<p>
This display is also a bit different because it shows the main menu bar and the
icon toolbar. The last menu in the menu bar is the normal Display Control
menu. We do this because the IDV can run without any other main windows
and the user may need to access the main menu bar.
<p>

The Multi-Display Holder contains a set of top-level <i>groups</i>.
These groups can be shown as tabs or as documents in a desktop view.
To switch between these top-level views choose the
[ug::menu {Multi Display} View {Show Desktop}] menu item.
You can add new top level groups by choosing the
[ug::menu {Multi Display} File New Tab] menu item.

<p>
Each of these top level groups can contain any number of sub-displays.
These sub-displays can themselves be groups, other display controls,
3D views or the Field Selector GUI.

<p>
The [ug::menu {Multi Display} Edit {Manage Displays...}] menu item
brings up the displays manager. This is a tree view of all of the
groups and sub-displays.
Right mouse clicking on any of the entries brings up a popup menu
that allows you to remove the item, show the properties for the item, etc.
You can drag an item and place it in a new group. Dragging does
not change the order of an item within its group though. To do that
use the group Properties dialog described below.

<p>
The Properties dialog for a Group allows to specify the kind of layout 
for the group (e.g., in tabs, grid or column based). The  Displays list
lists all of the sub-displays held by the group. You can change the 
order of an item by selecting it in the list and pressing
the up or down arrow button.
