{Text Notes}

{
<meta name="jhid" value="idv.controls.notecontrol">
The IDV has a provision for you to record text notes, either stand-alone or
associated with a display.  These notes can be saved in 
<a href="../../Bundles.html">Bundles</a>. Bundles are small files 
of information that allow the IDV to recreate a previous state
of data and displays.
<p>



To create a stand-alone text note choose from the main menu 
[ug::menu  Displays {Add text note}]. 
A window opens where you compose the note:

[ht::cimg  images/NoteControlGui1.gif]

After you have finished with the note and have the IDV in the state
you want to show in future, save  a named bundle file.


You can use a bundle for your own future reference, and you
can provide this file to colleagues
and they can use it to recreate the IDV state you saved.  The text
note you  saved with the bundle 
will appear on their screen when the IDV is started.
<p>

You can also attach a note to any or all individual parameter displays
through the properties window:  [ug::menu Edit {Properties}]. 
The text area will be opened in the bottom of the window in which 
you can compose your note.
