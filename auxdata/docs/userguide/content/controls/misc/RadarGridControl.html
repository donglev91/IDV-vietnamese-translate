{Range Rings}

{

<meta name="jhid" value="idv.controls.radargridcontrol">

The Range Rings control show a set of concentric circles
labeled by distance from the central point, with radial 
lines, useful for judging distance and angle from a geographic location.
Range Rings are often used with radar imagery.
The control window is composed of two tabs. The first allows
the user to specify the location of the range rings:

The second tab allows the user to control how the rings are displayed:

The Range Rings are oriented with local north-south on the displayed    
map projection. In some cases the eastward radial line may not be       
horizontal. 


<p>
You display Range Rings from the main menu with the 
[ug::menu Displays Special {Range Rings} ] menu. The Range Rings 
will appear centered on the map projection. You can move them by        
resetting the latitude-longitude or station as described below.         

The IDV can display several radar images at once, and range rings can   
be displayed for each one. You may display as many range rings at one   
time as you like, centered anywhere, not just radar locations.          

}


{{Location} {


The position of the center of the rings is shown in the text fields
[ht::command {Center latitude} ] and [ht::command {Center longitude} ]

To re-center the rings, you can select a radar station by name from the 
pull-down list, or you give new lat/lon values by entering values in a     
text field and pressing return. Note: west longitudes are negative.

{{Visibility} {
You can toggle the visibility of the range rings, labels, and radials   
on and off with the [ht::command Visible ] checkboxes. To toggle the     
entire radar grid at once, use [ug::menu View Visible ] checkbox menu.

{{Spacing} {
You can change the ring spacing, the label spacing, and the azimuth     
interval of the radials, using the control window. The values appear in 
the text fields under <code class="menu">Spacing</code>. You can give   
new values two ways: enter a new value in the text field by clicking in 
the field, entering the new value, and pressing Enter, or click on the  
pull-down arrow on the right side of the text field to see a list of    
common values.
