{Weather Text Product Control}

{
<meta name="jhid" value="idv.controls.textproductcontrol">

This control is used to display weather text products (forecasts,
warnings, watches, etc) produced by the National Weather Service
and other international meteorological agencies.
<p>
The user interface consists of 3 tabs.  The first allows the
user to select and display the text products.  The 
[ht::command Products] panel allows the user to select the
type of product to view. When a product is selected, the
available stations are plotted in the associated view window.
One or more stations can be selected by clicking on the
station in the view window (or Ctrl-click for multiple
stations).  When a station is selected, the text product
for that station is displayed.

The user can select between displaying the products as raw
text or as HTML by clicking on the tab at the bottom of
the text display area.

In the HTML view, you can toggle on a glossary which will 
highlight certain meteorological terms.  When the links
are clicked, a dialog will pop up with an explanation of
the term.

By default, the most recent text product is displayed.  
Multiple products can be displayed by selecting a time
range from the  [ht::command {Time Covered}] selector.
You can loop through multiple products using the
<a href="../ui/Animation.html">Time Animation</a> 
widget.  The time animation will be synched with any
other data in the associated view window.
<p>

The second tab controls the display of the station locations
in the associated View window.  It is the same as the
<a href="../StationLocationControl.html">Station Location 
Control's</a> [ht::command Display] tab.

When you select a product,
the available stations are shown in the View window.  This
tab can be used to control the station density and the layout
of the station identifiers.
<p>

The third tab lists information about the selected location
and shows lists of all the locations and the displayed  
selections.
