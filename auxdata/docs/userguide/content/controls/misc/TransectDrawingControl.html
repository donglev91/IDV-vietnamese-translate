The transect drawing control is a version
of the <a href="DrawingControl.html">Drawing Control</a>
that allows you to view, create and modify the transect lines
that are used in the <a href="../../ui/TransectViewManager.html">Transect Views</a>.

<p>
This display is either created through the [ug::menu Displays Special] menu
or through the [ug::menu Transects] menu in the Transect View.
<p>
This display control is a representation of the set of transects
that are defined by the transect resource. Not only does it have
its own state (that can be saved in a bundle for example) it also writes
out any transects you may create or change into your local IDV state
directory in a transects.xml file.
<p>

In this control there is  only one shape that you can draw with, the 
Transect Line. This control also shows a non-editable Transect Shape
which displays the full transect line used by any Transect Views.
We call these the &quot;Active Transects&quot;.
There are also a set of transect  lines that are non-editable that 
are from the system transects property.
<p>
For an active transect, if the Transect View that it represents 
has a  max distance set then the transect will show this max distance
as a rectangular box.
