The Profiler Time/Height display shows winds at all levels above one 
station, for one or more times. Winds are shown with the meteorological wind 
barb symbol. The location of the barb on the plot 
shows wind observation height above mean sea level; 
the barb's orientation gives wind direction on a map view.

Long:" readout above the graph. The time and height values on the plot  
can be sampled by dragging the middle mouse button over the plot.
