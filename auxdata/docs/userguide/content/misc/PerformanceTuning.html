<div class="overview">
If you are running into issues with memory consumption or slow response
of the IDV, there are several things you can do.
</div>


The amount of memory used by the IDV will depend on the size of
the datasets you use and the types of displays.  Datasets
rendered as 2D depictions (plan views - contours or color shaded
displays) use much less memory than 3D displays (isosurfaces,
cross sections).  Large datasets (images, dense grids) will
use much more memory.<p>  

There are several features in the IDV that allow you to more efficiently
view large datasets:

<%childlist%>

<subhead id="subset" xintoc="false" desc="Subsetting the data before
display reduces the memory and display time">Temporal/Spatial Subset of Data</subhead>

Some data sources allow you to subset the data temporally and spatially.
You can set these properties for all fields in a dataset through the
[ht::menu Properties] menu of the data source (double click on the
Data Source in the [ht::command {Field Selector}]) or you can set
these for individual field using the tabs in the lower right corner
of the [ht::command {Field Selector}].  For more information, see
the <a href="../data/DataSourceProperties.html">Data Source Properties</a>
section of the IDV User's Guide.

<subhead id="heap" xintoc="false" desc="Change the amount of
memory allocated to the IDV">Memory allocation</subhead>

By default, the IDV startup script (<b>runIDV</b> (Unix) or             
<b>runIDV.bat</b> (Windows)) tunes the amount of memory allocated 
to the IDV according to system parameters. On 64 bit computers, the memory 
allocation amount is 80% of the available RAM. On 32 bit computers, the 
amount is the minimum of 1.5GB and the available RAM minus 512MB. <p> 

In addition, users can change the memory settings in  the [ht::menu Edit Preferences],
<b>System</b> tab. In order for these changes to take effect, the user will have to
restart the IDV. <p>

In rare circumstances, the IDV start script cannot determine the optimal amount 
of memory for the IDV. In this unusual case, the IDV start script allocates 512MB. 
The user can still go to the [ht::menu Edit Preferences], <b>System</b> tab and adjust memory 
settings. Again, the user must restart the IDV in order for this to take effect. <p>

In other exceptional situations, the user may still wish to override the automatic
tuning mechanism. In the body of the runIDV script, there are instructions on how
to achieve this change, although this should rarely be necessary. <p>

<subhead id="cache" xintoc="false" desc="Data caching uses more
memory">Data Caching</subhead>

By default, the IDV caches the data used for a display in memory.
If a field is used more than once for several displays, caching
the data prevents an additional reading from of the data from
disk or a remote server.  If you are only displaying/using a
field (i.e. not using it for multiple displays or calculations), 
you can keep the IDV from caching it in memory.   You can
turn off data caching by unchecking the [ht::command {Cache data in memory}]
checkbox on the [ht::command {System}] tab of
the user preferences (accessible from the [ht::menu Edit Preferences] menu).


<a name="caching"></a>
<subhead id="cachetodisk" xintoc="false" desc="Data source field caching">Caching to disk</subhead>

The IDV has a caching facility where actively used data (e.g., gridded fields, satellite image, radar) is held in a memory cache. As the amount of data increases the IDV will write the data out to a temporary space on your local disk. If that data is needed again (e.g., rerendering the display) then the IDV will need to go to disk and re-read the data. This may cause some delays. 
<p>
The memory cache size is intially set at 30% of your maximum memory. This can be changed in the [ht::menu Edit Preferences], <b>System</b> tab.
<p>
In a worst case scenario you could have a very long animation loop of imagery. In this case every time one of the images is displayed while animating its data needs to be accessed. If you have very large images or a very long loop then the images needed to display will be on disk and the time it takes to read them from disk for display will be quite noticable. In this case you can reduce the resolution of the images, reduce the number of times being displayed or increase the cache and/or overall memory size.



<subhead id="maxsize" xintoc="false" desc="Reducing the maximum
size of a display can reduce the memory used">Maximum grid/image size</subhead>

You can also set the maximum size of a grid or image that will be displayed. 
This will allow you to download a large image or grid, but it will be 
re-sampled before displaying if it is larger than the maximum size you 
have asked for. You can set the maximum image/grid size under
the [ht::command {System}] tab of
the user preferences (accessible from the [ht::menu Edit Preferences] menu).

<subhead id="fastrender" xintoc="false" desc="Fast rendering reduces memory
and time at the expense of accuracy">Fast Rendering</subhead>

By default, the IDV will NOT try to adjust the data renderings to account
for projection seams. This is computationally intensive in some cases
and slows down the display of data.  When the preference
"Use Fast Rendering" (under the [ht::command General] tab of the user
preferences ([ht::menu Edit Preferences] menu)) is set, the IDV will not try
to account for the projection seams. If you are displaying data in
its native projection, this will result in faster rendering of the
data depiction. However, if you have several displays of data, each
from a different data source and on a different projection, you may see
anomalies in the displays (spurious lines, portions of images). At that
point, you can turn off fast rendering for a particular display using the
[ht::menu Edit Properties] menu of the Display Control for that display,
or set your system preference back to not use fast rendering.


<subhead id="multicores" xintoc="false" desc="Parallel Rendering and Data Reading">Parallel Rendering and Data Reading</subhead>

If you are running the IDV on  a multi-core machine you can configure the IDV 
to render individual time steps in parallel. You can also do remote data reads 
in parallel. This typically results in a 50% reduction in overall data 
reading and rendering time.
<p>
There are 2  preferences in the [ht::menu Edit Preferences], <b>System</b> tab.
One is the number of threads used for rendering. This defaults to the number
of processors on your machine. The second is the number of threads used for
data reading. This defaults to 4.  

<p>
For rendering the IDV will render each time step in parallel.
Note: since the rendering processes can allocate temporary memory it is 
possible to exhaust the available memory if too many threads are running
concurrently.  While we do not get linear speedup with the number of
cores available for rendering (probably due to memory contention issues)
we do see 40%-50% performance improvements for complex rendering tasks (e.g., contouring).

<p>
The second preference is used when reading individual time steps of data
from remote ADDE and OpenDAP servers. This parallelization takes advantage 
of the multiple cores available on the remote server and somewhat the 
available bandwidth on the network.
We do see a linear speed up in accessing remote data based on the 
number of cores on the remote server (ADDE or OpenDAP).
However, we've seen that if you load the server too much your performance 
is degraded, probably due to file system issues.
