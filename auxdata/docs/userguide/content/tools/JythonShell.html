[ug::head {Jython Shell}]


The Jython Shell is an interactive command line interface to the IDV Jython interpreter that allows the user to type in arbitrary jython to evaluate. It is brought up with the [ht::menu Edit Formulas {Jython Shell}] menu.

<h3>The User Interface</h3>

The Jython shell consists of an output window on the top and an input field on the bottom. The user enters Jython into the input field. When &quot;return&quot; or &quot;Evaluate&quot; is pressed the Jython is evaluated and any output is shown in the output window.

The icons show with every Jython entry in the output window allow you to select the particular jython on re-evaluate it.

The entry window can be expanded with the down arrow icons on the right.

Pressing the &quot;Up&quot; arrow and &quot;Down&quot; arrow (also control-P, control-N) in the entry field goes up and down through the history of commands.
