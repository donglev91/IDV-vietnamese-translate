<title>Real-time Collaboration in the IDV</title>

<div class="overview">
The IDV supports real-time, multi-user collaboration and sharing.
</div>

<ol class="step">
  
  <li>Collaboration is based on one or more IDV's being connected together. This
      topology can  be<p>
       peer-to-peer:
      [ht::cimg peertopeer.gif]

      multiple-client/single-server:
      [ht::cimg clientserver.gif] 

      or a heterogeneous  structure:
      [ht::cimg mixed.gif]

</li>
  
  <li>To start a collaborative session, open the [ht::dialog Collaboration]
      window   by selecting the [ht::menu Collaboration {Show Window}] menu item.</li>
  
  <li>The [ht::dialog Collaboration] window is composed of four tabs:</li>

  <ul class="substep">
    
    <li>The [ht::command Connect] tab allows you to connect to other machines or
        to
        start up a server on your machine.</li>
    
    <li>The [ht::command Clients] lists what other users you are connected
        with.</li>
    
    <li>The [ht::command Chat] tab provides for text chat with other users.</li>
    
    <li>The [ht::command Log] tab shows a log of messages.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <li>Remove  any displays you may have [ht::refresh] and
      connect to my machine by entering the presenter's computer's hostname in
      the [ht::command Connect to] field and press return.</li>
  
  <li>You can see the current connections under the [ht::command Clients]
      tab.</li>

  <ul class="substep">
    
    <li>You can turn on/off whether changes you make are sent to others with the
        [ht::button Ok to send changes] checkbox.</li>
    
    <li>You can turn on/off whether you receive other user's changes  with the
        [ht::button Ok to receive changes] checkbox.</li>
    
    <li>The [ht::button Ok to relay changes] checkbox is used when your IDV
        is acting as a server</li>
    
    <li>The checkboxes in the [ht::command Clients] list allow you to
        turn on or off the sending and receipt of changes for individual
        users.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <li>I am going to load in some data and create some displays.</li>
  
  <li>Now, I am going to disconnect all of you from my machine. I want you to
      connect up in a peer to peer fashion with your colleagues.</li>
  
  <ul class="substep">
    
    <li> Some of you will act as a server.
        Go to the [ht::command Connect] tab and click the
        [ht::button Start server]  button.</li>
    
    <li>Some of you will act as a client.
        Go to the [ht::command Connect] tab and enter the hostname of the
        machine you want to connect to.</li>
    
    <li>For the server machines you should see a dialog window popping
        up asking if it is OK to  accept the connection. Click the
        [ht::button   Yes]
        button.</li>
    
    <li>Now, play around a bit. Load in some data, create displays, change their
        state,
        enter some text in the chat window, etc.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
