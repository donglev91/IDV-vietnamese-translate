<title>Plugin Examples</title>


<div class="overview">
We don't have to use the Plugin Creator. Plugins are just jar files or even
stand alone resource files that the IDV loads into its resource lists.
Let's look at some example plugins.
</div>

<ul>
<li> cd to the plugins directory and make a tmp directory to unjar some plugins into: 
[ht::cmdline {
cd auxdata/plugins<br>
mkdir tmp<br>
cd tmp<br>
jar -xvf ../gempak.jar
}]

<li> Look at the gempak.rbi file. We have this here to name and categorize the color tables.

<li> We have no examples but plugin jar files can also contain class files.
It turns out that if you include a class file in a plugin of a class that
is derived from one of the manager classes the IDV will automatically use that
class as the manager, obviating the need to have a custom  doMakeManger method.
e.g., ExampleUIManager.


<li> Let's discuss the trade-offs between building a McIDAS-V as a stand alone application 
or releasing it as a plugin.
