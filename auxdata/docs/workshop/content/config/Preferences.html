<title>Basic  Preferences</title>


<div class="overview">
In this section we will briefly cover how to change user preferences.
</div>

<ol class="step">
  <li>Select the [ht::menu Edit  {Preferences}] menu
      item to bring up the [ht::dialog User Preferences] window.
      This window consists of seven tabs.</li>
  
  <li>Select the [ht::command General] tab.</li>
  <ul class="substep">
      <li>The [ht::command Show Dashboard on Start] and 
          [ht::command Show Help Tip Dialog] checkboxes allow you to 
          control what windows are shown automatically.</li>
      
      <li>The [ht::command When Opening a Bundle] section allows you to control
      the behavior of the IDV when a bundle is opened.

      <li> [ht::command Show Windows When They Are Created] controls if 
          the display windows are shown or not when they are not docked
          in the Dashboard.

      <li>As we will discuss later, the [ht::command Resource Sitepath] is one 
          way to specify where to look for application resources. 
	  The command line argument:<br>
          [ht::filename   -sitepath]<br>
          is saved as a user preference.</li>
      
      </ul>

<li> Go to the [ht::command Formats and Data] tab.

<ul>
  <li> Try changing the [ht::command Date Format] and click 
       [ht::command Apply].  Notice that the format of the times
       in the [ht::command Time Animation Widget] and
       [ht::command Display List] changes to the new format.

  <li> Change [ht::command Latitude/Longitude] format to a higher precision, 
       e.g.  &quot;##0.00000&quot; and click [ht::command Apply].  Move
       the cursor around in the view window and notice the precision of
       the  values in the [ht::command Cursor Readout].

  <li> The [ht::command Probe Format] is an html template for displaying 
        data probe results. Try mousing over the text field to show a 
        tooltip that describes the format.

  <li> The [ht::command Distance Unit] is used for controls and
       readouts that use distances. 

  <li> [ht::command Sampling Mode] is used in the displays to determine  
       how grids are sampled.</li>
      
  <li> Tune performance and memory use with the [ht::command Caching], 
       [ht::command Max Image Size] and [ht::command Grid Cache Threshold].

</ul>

    <li>Select the [ht::command View] tab. These are preferences used 
        in the map display to determine clipping, wireframe display, 
        background color, etc.</li>
    
    <ul class="substep">
      <li> Check the  [ht::command Show Display List] option.
      <li> Uncheck the [ht::command Show Times in View] option.
      <li> Set the [ht::command Display List] font to 
           URW Gothic, 14 point.  
      <li>Change the [ht::command Display List] color to white.
      <li>Change the [ht::command Default Projection] to <b>US>CONUS</b>.
      <li>Check the [ht::command Show Logo in View] option
      <li>Press [ht::button Apply].
    </ul>
    
    <li>Select the [ht::command Navigation] tab. This allows 
        you to define different mouse and key bindings. 

    <li>Select the [ht::command Toolbar] tab. This allows you top 
        define what toolbar icons are shown on the toolbar.
    
<li>Select the [ht::command System] tab. These are preferences used
    to change the system settings such as the amount of memory
    allocated to the IDV, data caching, threading and some Java 3D settings.
    In order for these changes to take effect, the user will have to restart the IDV.</li>

    <ul class="substep">
      <li> [ht::command Memory] You can set the amount of memory allocated to the IDV as a
          percentage of the total system memory or a specific amount (in megabytes). 
          On 32-bit systems, the maximum is 1.5 gigabytes (1500 MB).
      <li> [ht::command Thread Count] Taking advantage of mulitple core chip architectures, the user can
        set both the thread count for rendering and for data reading. For rendering, each time step for
        each display is rendered separately, and 2 threads is optimal due to memory issues.
      <li> Set the [ht::command Java 3D/Enable geometry by reference] If you have problems with
        spurious map lines, turn this off.
        
    </ul>
</ol>
