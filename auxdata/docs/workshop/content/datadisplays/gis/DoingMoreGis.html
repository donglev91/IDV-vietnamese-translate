<li> Create a three pane view.
Show the [ht::display Topography Background Image] in one pane. 
Load in the DEM data we viewed earlier and create a [ht::display Color Shaded Plan View]
in the second pane. Create a  [ht::display 3D Surface/Topography] display in the third pane.
<p>
Add [ht::display Data Transect] displays for the DEM data in each of the 3 view windows.
Turn on sharing  in each of the 3 [ht::display Data Transect] displays with the [ht::menu Edit Sharing {Sharing On}] menu
item. Move the transects around in the display.


<li> Load in a topographic map background and the roads and stream shapefiles for your own
county. Look around to see how they match up.

<li> Look at hot springs in Colorado.  Turn on county maps 
in the [ht::display Background Maps] and load in the location file:
