<div class="overview">
We'll look at accessing other Web Map Servers.
</div>

<ol class="step">
<li> [ht::clearDisplays]
<li> Bring up a two pane [ht::command Globe] display
with the [ht::menu File New {View Window} {Globe Display} {Two Panes}]
menu item.

<li> Note the currently selected view window is bordered in blue.
This is the window that any newly created displays will be placed in.
Also note that these two windows are synchronized.


<li>  Now, let's select some other WMS imagery.
<ul>
<li> [ht::openDataSourceChooser]
<li> Select the [ht::command Catalogs] tab
<li> Select [ht::dataset Web Map Servers]
<li> Select the [ht::dataset JPL-OnEarth] WMS
<li> Select the [ht::param Blue Marble,...] layer and press [ht::button Add Source]
<li> The [ht::display WMS] display control is automatically created.

</ul>
<li> Let's add a WMS image in the other globe display.
<ul>
<li> First, click in the other globe display to select it.
<li> Open the [ht::dialog Data Source Chooser] window and press the back arrow
to return to the catalog listing.
<li> Select the [ht::dataset NGDC]-&gt;[ht::dataset Paleoclimatology]-&gt;[ht::dataset Climate Timeline] (double clicking if it has already been opened).
<li> Control-click on [ht::param Ecoregion Domains],
[ht::param Average Annual Temperature] and [ht::param Average Annual Precipitation]
and then press [ht::button Add Source]
<li> Note the [ht::display WMS] display control has a
[ht::command Layer Type] menu that allows you to switch between the selected
layers.
</ul>



<li> The paired view displays are configured to not show the legend.
To show the legend or to bring up the display control windows
select use the [ht::menu View] menu.

<li> Just for kicks, turn on autorotate with the
[ht::menu View {Auto-rotate}] menu item.
