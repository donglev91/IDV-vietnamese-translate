<div class="overview">
NASA'S WorldWind program comes with a tiled location database that allows for
progressive disclosure of locations as you zoom in. The IDV makes use
of this database.
</div>

<ol class="step">

<li> Start fresh by clearing all displays and data [ht::refresh] and go
to a CONUS projection ([ht::menu Projections Predefined US CONUS] menu item).

<li> Create the [ht::display WorldWind] display control
from the [ht::menu Displays Special {WorldWind Locations}] menu item. 

<li> This is just like the [ht::display Location ] display control except it progressively discloses more detailed locations
as you zoom.

<li> Zoom into Colorado and watch how the display changes.

<li> Zoom into Boulder. Remember, if things go blank you just zoomed
past the surface of the Earth. Use the [ht::menu Projections {Use Displayed Area}] menu item to reset the projection.

<li> Add a [ht::display Background Image] and change the layer
to [ht::param Urban Area]. 

<li> Keep zooming. 

<li> Remove the [ht::display Background Image] display control.

<li> Change projections to some other part of the world  and see what is listed.
