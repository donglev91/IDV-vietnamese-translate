<ol class="step">

  <li>Using the latest 80 km CONUS North American Model (NAM) data, create 
      a display of color filled contours of sea level pressure, 500 hPa heights
      and isosurface of wind speed.</li>

  <li>Display sea level pressure as contours draped over topography.</li>

  <li>Create another color filled contour as topography display of sea level pressure and compare with
    the other one.</li>

  <li>Use the [ht::menu Edit {Remove All Displays}] menu to remove the displays.

  <li>Create display of geopotential height contours at 500 mb on a topography
      surface of the pressure from the latest GFS 80 km CONUS grid.
       <ul>
       <li>Create a color filled contour display of geopotential height
       over topography.  When prompted for the topography field, select
       geopotential height.
       <li> Now do the same for contours over topography.
       <li> Turn sharing for both displays.
       <li> Set the level to 500 hPa.
       <li> Set the vertical scale to 4800 to 6000 meters to exaggerate the
            effect.
       </ul>
   </li>

   <li>Create another color filled contour as topography display of geopotential height at 500 mb and compare with
    the other one.

   <li>Use the [ht::menu Edit {Remove All Displays and Data}] menu to remove the displays and data.
