<div class="overview">
<p> Displaying ensemble grids in the IDV can be memory
intensive.  If you are reading from a remote server, you also
have to deal with the latency of reading the grids across the
internet.  There are several strategies you can use to reduce
the amount of memory used by the IDV.
</p>

<ol class="step">

<li>First, let's load in a ensemble grid.

  <ul class="substep">
    <li>If you have not already done so, use the
        [ht::menu Edit {Remove All Displays}] menu to remove the displays
        created in the previous exercise.</li>
    <li>In the [ht::tab Catalog] data chooser, select the
        [ht::menu {Main IDV Catalog} {Unidata IDD Model Data} {UCAR(motherlode)} {GlobalEnsemble Forecast System Model} {NCEP-GEFS-Global 1p0deg Ensemble with Ensemble Dimension} {latest NCEP-GEFS-Global 1p0deg Ensemble with Ensemble Dimension}] dataset.  </li>
    <li>In the [ht::command Fields] panel,
        expand the [ht::param 3D grid] tab and the [ht::param Mass] tab. Select the
        [ht::param geopotential height], the [ht::display Contour Plan View] display.  </li>
    <li>In the [ht::command Fields] subset panel, and set the
        [ht::command Level] to be 500 hectopascals, on the [ht::command Times ] tab, uncheck the
        [ht::command Use All] box,  right click on the panel and select the
        [ht::menu {Select every third one}] menu option ,
        set the [ht::command Region] to conver [ht::command US CONUS], on the [ht::command Ensemble] tab, select the
        [ht::command  All Members], or use the combination of Ctl and left mouse button
        and select a few members in the listand, then click
        the [ht::command Create Display] button.  </li>
    <li>User can change the range of color table to refelct how many members selected, the default range is 0 to 20,
         and the user can also disable "Color by Member"
         in the display control tab. The user will then have the capability of
         choosing an appropriate color table and color range for their data. </li>
    <li>After creating the display, the user can specify irregular contour intervals with a
         semi-colon separated list of the values in the [ht::command Contour Property Editor]. For example:
         entering 5460;5800 would only show the 5460 and 5800 contour lines. </li>

    <li> There are a few sample bundles in the Data/Grids/Ensemble folder.</li>
  </ul>
