<title>Isosurfaces of Gridded Data </title>

<div class="overview">
While plan views of 3D fields are useful, the three dimensionality
of the atmosphere can be displayed in the IDV using isosurfaces.
An isosurface represents a 3-D surface that connects points with the same
value.  On one side of the surface, values are greater than the
surface value; on the other side, values are less than the surface
value.
</div>

<ol class="step">

<li>Create an isosurface of wind speed showing areas of winds 40 m/s
or greater.

  <ul class="substep">
<!--
    <li>If you have not already done so, use the 
        [ht::menu Edit {Remove All Displays}] menu to remove the displays
        created in the previous exercise.  Set the viewpoint to the
        top.
-->

    <li>In the [ht::dialog Field Selector]'s [ht::command Data Sources] 
        panel, select the [ht::dataset  NCEP Model Data ETA data source]
        that you loaded at the start of this section.</li>

    <li>In the [ht::command Fields] panel, expand 
        the [ht::param 3D grid] tab. 
        Scroll down to the [ht::param Derived] tab to see 
        a list of derived quantities. Select the 
        [ht::param {Speed (from GridRelative_u &amp; GridRelative_v)}] 
        field.

    <li>In the [ht::command Displays] panel, 
        expand the [ht::param 3D Surface] tab and select 
        [ht::display Isosurface], then
        click the [ht::button Create Display] button.</li>

    <li>Set the isosurface to display where winds of 40 m/s or greater
        exist. From the control window for this display, you can change
        the isosurface value either by typing a 
        new value in the [ht::command Isosurface Value] entry box 
        or by using the [ht::command Isosurface Value] slider widget
        ([ht::img %dotpath%images/Slider16.gif {slider widget}])
        to the right of the entry box. Change the isosurface value to
        <b>40 m/s</b>.</li>

    <li>Start the animation.</li>

    <li>Rotate the display to see the wind speed pods from various angles.</li>

    <li>Stop the animation and return the display back to the first
        time in the sequence and the view to the top.</li>

    <li>Remove the display from the main window by clicking on 
        the remove icon ([ht::img %dotpath%/images/Remove16.gif])
        or by selecting the control's [ht::menu File {Remove Display}] 
        menu.</li>
        
  </ul>
</li>

<li>You can also create isosurfaces of one variable that is colored
by another variable.  In this step, you will load in an isosurface
of wind speed again, but this time you will have it colored
by geopotential height.

  <ul class="substep">
    <li>In the [ht::command Fields] panel, expand the 
        [ht::param 3D grid] tab. 
        Scroll down to the [ht::param Derived] tab to see 
        a list of derived quantities. Select the 
        [ht::param {Speed (from GridRelative_u &amp; GridRelative_v)}] 
        field.
    <li>In the [ht::command Displays] panel, 
        expand the [ht::param 3D Surface] tab and select 
        [ht::display Isosurface colored by another parameter]
        then click the [ht::button Create Display] button.
        (you may have to scroll the [ht::command Displays] 
        pane to find the display selection)</li>
    <li>After you click the [ht::button Create Display] 
        button, a dialog will pop up to allow you to select the
        [ht::param Other parameter].  From the dialog, 
        expand the [ht::param 3D grid]
        node and select the [ht::param geopotential height] 
        field and click the [ht::button OK] button.</li>
    <li>Adjust the wind speed value to <b>40 m/s</b>.</li>
    <li>Start the animation.</li>
    <li>Rotate the display to see the wind speed pods from various angles.</li>

    <li>Stop the animation and return the display back to the first
        time in the sequence and the view to the top.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>You can modify the colors the display through the menus 
in the control window or legend.

  <ul class="substep">
    <li>You can use a different color table to show the variation of
        windspeed with altitude.  Click on the [ht::button default] 
        button next to the [ht::command Color table] label in the 
        control window to bring up a list of pre-defined 
        color tables.  Select the [ht::menu Basic] menu
        and choose the [ht::menu Bright38] menu item
        to change to that color table.  In a later exercise, you will
        learn how to create and modify your own color tables.</li>

    <li>Rotate the display so you are looking at the view from the
        south.  On the first time-step, the pod of 40 m/s winds bulges
        down into the blues of the color table.  Place your cursor
        at the bottom of this bulge and note the Altitude readout
        at the bottom of the main window.  It should read about
        5000 m.</li>

    <li>Now move your cursor over the color bar in the legend to the
        point where the color at the bottom of the bulge is.  Notice
        that the readout on the color bar is about 5000 m as well.</li>

<!--
    <li>Change the units of display from m/s to kts.  In the control
        panel for this display, or by right clicking on the legend, 
        select the [ht::menu Edit {Change Display Unit...}] menu.  Type in 
        &quot;kt&quot; in the [ht::command New unit:]
        entry box and click the [ht::button OK]
        button.  Although the display did not change, the labels
        in the legend and the control window changed to show the
        values in units of knots.

    <li>Adjust the wind speed isosurface value to <b>90 kts</b>.</li>
-->

    <li>Start the animation.</li>

    <li>Rotate the display to see the wind speed pods from various angles.</li>

    <li>Stop the animation and return the display back to the first
        time in the sequence.</li>
  </ul>
