<div class="overview">
<p> Displaying high resolution grids in the IDV can be memory
intensive.  If you are reading from a remote server, you also
have to deal with the latency of reading the grids across the
internet.  There are several strategies you can use to reduce
the amount of memory used by the IDV.
</p>
</div>

<ol class="step">

<li>First, let's load in a high resolution grid.

  <ul class="substep">
    <li>If you have not already done so, use the 
        [ht::menu Edit {Remove All Displays and Data}] menu to remove the displays
        created in the previous exercise.</li>
    <li>In the [ht::tab Catalog] data chooser, select the
        [ht::menu {Main IDV Catalog} {Unidata IDD Model Data} {UCAR(motherlode)} {North American Model} {NCEP NAM CONUS 12 km} {latest NCEP NAM CONUS 12km}] dataset.  
  </ul>

<li>Now, let's subset the grid.
    <ul>

    <li>[ht::editDataSourceProperties [ht::dataset {Latest NCEP NAM CONUS 12km}]]
    <li>You can subset the grid by time and/or by coverage.
        <ul>
        <li>Click on the [ht::tab Times] tab.  select the
           [ht::command Use Selected] menu item.  Right click on the panel
           and select the [ht::menu {Select every third one}] menu option.</li>
        <li>Click on the [ht::tab Spatial Subset] tab.  You can spatially
            subset the grid by stride (e.g. every nth point) and/or by
            region.  Set the [ht::command X Stride] to 
            [ht::param Every third point].  Notice that the 
            [ht::command Y Stride] is linked to the [ht::command X Stride].
        <li>Optionally, keep the stride at [ht::param All points] and
            select a sub-region on the map.
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In the [ht::dialog Field Selector], select the
        [ht::param {3D grid-&gt;Temperature @ pressure}] field and
        the [ht::display Contour Plan View] display.</li>
    <li>Since we are displaying a single level, you can further reduce
    the grid by selecting a level instead of the entire grid.  
    In the [ht::tab Level] tab of the [ht::command Data Subset] panel, 
    select the [ht::param 50000 Pa] (500 millibar) level.
    <li>Click the [ht::button Create Display] button.
    </ul>
