    <title>Adaptive Resolution in Satellite Imagery</title>
</head>

<body>

<div class="overview">
    <p>In this exercise, we'll load in some high resolution visible imagery from the GINI East 1km dataset.</p>
</div>

<p>When loading a high resolution satellite imagery with the [ht::command {Adaptive Resolution}] turned on,
    the IDV calculates the resolution of
    the view window, sets the magnification factors dynamically, and loads a sufficient amount
    of the data to generate an image at the correct resolution. With the [ht::command {Match Display Region}]
    option turned on, a rubber band box (RBB) interface allows the user to zoom in/out or change the
    projection, forcing the IDV to recalculate the magnification factors and get higher/lower
    resolution data. This feature improves the IDV memory usage and performance significantly. </p>

<p>The [ht::command {Adaptive Resolution}] is a property in the User Preference. It can also be set in
    the Projections drop down menu of main view window. If a display has been created without
    the [ht::command {Adaptive Resolution}] turned on, it can be changed by selecting the option
    under [ht::menu View {Match Display Region}] drop down menu in the same display control.</p>

    <li>[ht::clearDisplaysAndData]</li>

    <li>[ht::openDataSourceChooser]
        Click on the [ht::command Images] node in the chooser tree.</li>

    <li>In the [ht::command Server:] selector, choose
        [ht::param adde.ucar.edu].
        In the [ht::command Dataset:] selector, choose
        [ht::param GINIEAST], click the [ht::button Connect]
        button.</li>

    <li>From the [ht::command Image Type:] selector, choose
        the [ht::param GINI 1 km VIS East CONUS] type.</li>

    <li>You can either load in the last &quot;<i>n</i>&quot; images, or
        you can select by time.  For this exercise, we want to select
        5 most recent of the relative times.    </li>

    <li> Click the [ht::button Add Source] button.</li>


    <li>Match display region:
        <ul>
            <li>In the [ht::dialog Map View] window, zoom into the region of interested.</li>

            <li>In the [ht::dialog Data Subset] panel, click on the [ht::command Region] tab and
                click on the drop down menu button and choose the [ht::command Match Display Region] option.</li>

            <li>Click the [ht::command Create Display] button.</li>
        </ul>


    <li>Use the [ht::menu View {Match Display Region}] menu in the same display control to check and make sure
    the [ht::command Match Display Region] option has been selected. If a different menu item under
    the [ht::command Region] tab is selected, this property can be changed in this drop down menu.

    <li>In the [ht::dialog Map View] window, use the combination of [ht::button Shift] and left mouse button
    to create rubber band box [ht::command RBB].</li>

    <li>Zoom in and out and draw [ht::command RBB] to different areas, and check the data sampling factor that
    is shown in the side legend.</li>
