<title>Probing Level III Data</title>

<body>

<div class="overview">
Just as we could probe gridded data, we can also probe the 
satellite and radar images.
</div>

First, let's add a data probe to the display we created in
the previous exercise.

<ol class="step">

  <li>Complete the previous two exercises.</li>

  <li>In the [ht::dialog Field Selector] window, 
      make sure the [ht::dataset DVN (Base Reflectivity Tilt 1)] 
      dataset is selected in the [ht::command Data Sources]
      panel and the [ht::display Image Sequence] field 
      is selected in the [ht::command Fields] panel.
      In the [ht::command Displays] panel, select
      [ht::display Data Probe/Time Series], and then click the 
      [ht::command Create Display] button.</li>
      
  <li>In the main view window, you will see a small red probe
      in the middle.  Move the probe around over the echoes and
      notice the value changing in the [ht::dialog Data Probe] control window.
      <popup label="Can't find probe?">
      If you can't see the probe, toggle off the radar image
      by clicking off the legend visibility checkbox for that display.
      </popup>

  <li>Set the time animation to the first timestep.</li>

  <li>Move the probe to the leading edge of the bow echo and turn
      on the time animation.  Note that the value readout 
      in the [ht::dialog Probe control] changes
      to show the value at that position for each time step.</li>
  
  <li>Stop the animation and return to the first timestep.</li>

  <li>Use the [ht::menu Displays Special {Range and Bearing}] menu
      to add in the range and bearing tool.  Position the left end
      point of the probe on the radar grid at 100km and 180 degrees.

  <li>Animate through the time sequence one step at a time, keeping
      track of where the cell that was under the left end point of the
      probe has moved to.  Stop on the last timestep.</li>
      
  <li>Position the right end of the range and bearing probe at 
      the point where the cell has moved to.  How fast did the storm move?

  <li>Remove all displays.</li>

</ol>
