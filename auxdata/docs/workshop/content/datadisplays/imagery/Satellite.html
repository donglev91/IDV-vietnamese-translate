<title>Loading Satellite Imagery</title>

<div class="overview">
Satellite imagery from geostationary and polar orbiting satellites
is available through a network of servers supported by Unidata.
Most of the imagery available on these servers covers the 
North America region.  These servers use the Abstract Data
Distribution Environment (ADDE) protocol.
</div>

<p>First, we'll load in some visible imagery from the Bow Echo
Case Study that we used in the <b>Gridded Data</b> section of
the workshop.</p>

<ol class="step">
  <li>[ht::clearDisplaysAndData]</li>

  <li>[ht::openDataSourceChooser] 
      Click on the [ht::command Images] node in the chooser tree.</li>

  <li>We'll load in some visible satellite imagery.
      In the [ht::command Server:] selector, choose
      [ht::param adde.ucar.edu].  
      In the [ht::command Dataset:] selector, choose
      [ht::param CCS039].  If either of these is
      not in the list, just type them in.  When you have made 
      your selections, click the [ht::button Connect]
      button.</li>

  <li>The IDV connects to the specified server and retrieves 
      the types of images available in the dataset.  From the
      [ht::command Image Type:] selector, choose
      the [ht::param 1 km GOES-8 Visible] type.</li>

  <li>You can either load in the last &quot;<i>n</i>&quot; images, or
      you can select by time.  For this exercise, we want to select
      a subset of all available times:    </li>
    <ul class="substep">
        <li>Click on the[ht::command Absolute times] radio button.
           <p> When this option is selected, the server is queried for a set of
            available times for that type and these are listed in the
            [ht::command Times:] panel.</li>

        <li>Select [ht::listSelect] the 7 images from [ht::param 1998-06-29 16:15:00Z]
            through [ht::param 1998-06-29 22:15:00Z].</li>

        <li> Click the [ht::button Add Source] button.</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Compare three spatial subset options:
      <p>In the [ht::dialog Data Subset] panel, there are [ht::command Times], [ht::command Region], and [ht::command Advanced] tabs.</p>
      <ul>
          <li>In the [ht::command Region] tab, click on the drop down menu button and
              by default the [ht::command Use Default Region] option is selected. </li>

          <li>Click the [ht::command Create Display] button. The images created in the [ht::dialog Map View] window
              cover the entire region of the dataset. Zoom in over the super cell in eastern Iowa</li>

          <li>Remove the display and keep the data by click [ht::command Trash] icon in the legend panel</li>

          <li>Back in the data subset panel, in the [ht::command Region] tab, click on the drop down menu button and
              choose the [ht::command Select A Region] option. </li>

          <li>Draw a bonding box in eastern Iowa with left mouse button and click the [ht::command Create Display] button.</li>

          <li>In the [ht::dialog Map View] window, zoom into the region in eastern Iowa covered with the convective cloud. </li>

          <li>Remove the display and keep the data by click [ht::command Trash] icon in the legend panel, do not
               change the map view region in the [ht::dialog Map View] window.</li>

          <li>Back in the data subset panel, in the [ht::command Region] tab,
              click on the drop down menu button and choose the [ht::command Match Display Region] option, click
              the [ht::command Create Display] button.</li>
          <li>Keep images created in the last spatial subset option.</li>
      </ul>


  <li>[ht::mapChange]  Turn on the 
      [ht::command North & Central America] and
      the [ht::command US Interstate Highways] maps.
      Make sure all other maps are off.  When you are finished,
      go back to the [ht::dialog View Window].</li>

  <li>Use the [ht::menu Displays Locations US {U.S. Cities}] menu to
      overlay some place names. Change the color of the location
      text to be white using the display control's 
      [ht::menu Edit Color] menu.

  <li>Start the animation.  In this loop, you will see a large
      super cell thunderstorm develop over Iowa during this period.
      Stop the animation and show the 20:15Z image.</li>

  <li>Zoom in over the super cell in eastern Iowa</li>

  [ht::cimg images/VisImage.gif]

  <li>This is visible imagery at 1 kilometer resolution.  You can
      use the [ht::command Pixel Sampling] slider
      to see what the image would look like at a lower resolution.
      <ul class="substep">
        <li>Move the slider to <b>5</b> to see the difference 
            an image at 6 km resolution would look like.</li>

        <li>Return the slider back to <b>0</b> before proceeding to 
            the next exercise.</li>
            
        <li>Do not clear this display.</li>
      </ul>

</ol>
