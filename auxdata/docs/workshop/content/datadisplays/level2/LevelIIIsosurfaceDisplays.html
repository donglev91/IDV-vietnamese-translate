<div class="overview">
<p>This IDV display shows isosurfaces of WSR-88D Level II volume scans.
</p>
</div>

<p>

If necessary, select Level II data and times as described in
[ht::popup "LoadingLevelIIData.html" "Accessing WSR-88D Level II Radar Data"].

<ol class="step">

<li>[ht::clearDisplays]

<li>If you have not already done so, select one time from the data source. 
  <ul class="substep">
    <li>[ht::editDataSourceProperties [ht::dataset {Level II Radar Data (DVN)}]]
    <li>From the [ht::tab Times] tab, 
        select [ht::param {1998-06-29 21:29:59Z}] time.</li>
    <li>Click the [ht::button OK] button.
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>In the [ht::dialog Field Selector] window create a 
    [ht::display Radar Isosurface] display using the 
    [ht::param Reflectivity] field.</li>

<li>See the Display in 3D</li>
  <ul class="substep">
    <li>A 3D display of the isosurfaces  appears in the main  window.
    It is complex because the initial isosurface value is low, and there
    are many low values in the display.
    <details link="What are Radar Reflectivity Isosurfaces?">
    An isosurface is a 3D analog of a contour line. It shows the 
    location of all data with a single data value. Interpolation is used 
    between sweep altitudes in the IDV isosurface plot of Level II data. 
    All data in a volume scan is used. 
    <P>
    A radar isosurface from a line of thunderstorms, with surface value
    50 dBZ, shows the location and shape of the 50 dBZ cores, to the
    precision permitted by several horizontal sweeps separated by
    a thousand or more meters in most cases.
    </details>

 
    <li>Change the isosurface value to 50.0 dBZ 
    with the [ht::command Isosurface Value] slider in the control window. 
    <li>Rotate, pan, and zoom in as needed to see the new display in 3D.
  
    <li>What kind of weather system produced this radar result?
    What are the vertical shapes with isosurface value 50.0 dBZ?
    What does this arrangement of them mean?
    The IDV's default view has vertical exaggeration.
