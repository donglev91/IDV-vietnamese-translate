<div class="overview">
<p>
The IDV makes a pseudo-RHI display from Level II data. The display
is presented  in a conventional 2D plot, and in a 3D display at 
the correct position in the atmosphere.
</div>

The pseudo-RHI display is constructed from the several 
azimuthal sweeps available in the WSR-88D Level II output files.

<p>

If necessary, select Level II data and times as described in
[ht::popup "LoadingLevelIIData.html" "Accessing WSR-88D Level II Radar Data"].

<p>

<ol class="step">

<li>[ht::clearDisplays]

<li>In the [ht::dialog Field Selector] window create a [ht::display RHI]
    display using the [ht::param Reflectivity] field.</li>
<p> 

The RHI control window appears in the [ht::dialog Dashboard]. 
The RHI display appears inside the RHI control window as a 2D plot.

<li>The RHI also appears in the main 3D view window.
    View the RHI in 3D, and change the azimuth.</li>
  <ul class="substep">
   <li>Rotate, pan, and zoom  the 3D display as needed to see the
    RHI in 3D.
    <popup label="More about RHI displays">
    Note the center and vertical 
    width of the beams making up the "RHI" are in their
    actual locations in the atmosphere. You can show any 
    Level II 3D radar display in 
    the IDV with other upper air data, such as NOAA Profiler Network winds.
    The initial vertical exaggeration in the IDV is about 13:1.
    </popups>
    <li>Change the azimuth by dragging with the left mouse button on 
    the small square box at the outer end of the selector line above the RHI.
    <li>If desired, restore the initial overhead 
    viewpoint with the key combination Ctrl-r.</li>

  </ul>
</li>


<li>Working with the 2D RHI display</li>
  <ul class="substep">
    <li>Pan the 2D display with a right mouse button drag, 
    and zoom the display by dragging the right mouse button forward
    and backward with the Shift key pressed.
    <li>You can get the distance-height coordinate 
    at any point on the 2D plot with the middle mouse button.
    <li>You can get the data value for a color by placing the mouse cursor 
    anywhere on the color bar.
    <li>You can auto-rotate the RHI in both displays by clicking on the
    [ht::button Autorotate RHI] button. 
    Click Autorotate on and watch both 2D and 3D displays.
    <li>Make a 3D sweep display for the same data,
    and watch the RHI move across the sweep.</li>
    <li>Click off [ht::button Autorotate RHI].</li>
  </ul>
</li>
