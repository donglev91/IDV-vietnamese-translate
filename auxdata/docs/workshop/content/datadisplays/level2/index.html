<title>WSR-88D Level II Data Displays</title>

<div class="overview">
The IDV reads WSR-88D Level II data files.
Each file has data for one complete volume scan of the atmosphere,  
including sweeps at several elevations. 
The IDV displays the data 
as sweeps and RHIs, in 2D and 3D, and as 3D isosurfaces.
The IDV can be used for a general purpose Level II data viewer, and can also
combine Level II data displays with other meteorological data, in 2D plots
 and in 3D displays in the upper atmosphere.
