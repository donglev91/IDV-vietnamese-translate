<div class="overview">
You can draw across time steps.
</div>

<ol class="step">

<li> First, start fresh, removing all displays and data [ht::refresh]

<li>  For this exercise we created a &quot;Favorite Bundle&quot; that has the
Davenport Radar displays. We'll discuss favorite bundles later. Open this with the
[ht::menu Displays {Favorite Bundles} {Toolbar} {Workshop} {Davenport Radar}] menu item.
This should load in the Davenport radar and displays we used earlier.


<li>  In this exercise we are going to annotate this radar display with the 
[ht::display Drawing Control].

<li> Create a [ht::display Drawing Control] with either the
[ht::menu Displays Special {Drawing Control}] menu item or with the
<img src="images/Pencil16.gif"> toolbar button.

<li> Setup the control
<ul> 

<li> Choose &quot;Lat/Lon&quot; for the Location.
<li> Move the Z Position above the Bottom setting.
<li> Select the [ht::button Draw in current time] checkbox.
<li> Under the [ht::command Style] tab change the color to something that will stick out, e.g., cyan
<li> Change the line width to 6
</ul>

<li> Annotate the radar display
<ul>
<li> Select  a cell in the Bow Echo.
<li> Circle the cell with a polygon.
<li> Step the time animation forward one step. Note: the previous polygon is no longer
shown.
<li> Circle the cell of interest.
<li> Repeat.
</ul>


<li> Now, start the time animation.

<li> Stop the time animation and select the [ht::button Show all] button on
the [ht::display Drawing Control]
