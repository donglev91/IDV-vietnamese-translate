<ol class="step">

  <li>Create a plot of Surface (METAR) data for 12Z today.
      Overlay the contours of mean sea level pressure for the same time
      from the NAM model.

  <li>Load in the latest 12Z RUC model data.  Create a 
      [ht::display {Color-Filled Contour Plan View}] display of 
      [ht::param {Temperature at fixed height above ground}] for the
      initial time step.  Overlay regular contours of the same field
      in black.  Create a plot of the 12Z surface data for the same time
      with a [ht::command Temperature] station model.  How do the grid
      and observations compare?</li>
