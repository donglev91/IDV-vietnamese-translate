How to merge Profiler winds with other upper air data in one display.

</div>

<ol class="step">

Choices of numbers of stations, background maps, 
map projection, wind barb size, and vertical interval can 
make Profiler displays which range from very sparse to very 
complex. Work with just the data you want to see and try
 different choices to bring out the best of the Profiler data.  

<li>Use Data Projection</li>
  <ul class="substep">
    <li>Click on the [ht::menu View {Use Data Projection}]
    menu item in the control window.
    <li>The display is remapped to show the data in its native data projection.
    This is very useful for Profiler plots if your previous 
    projection was not suitable for
    showing the data. For example, if you were looking at model output
    over North America before you looked at Profiler, and the
    menu item [ht::menu Projections {Auto-set Projection}]
    was not checked on, the Profiler display is very small.
  </ul>
</li>

<li>Merging Data</li>
  <ul class="substep">
    <li>Make a 3D View of Profiler winds from a few stations, in
    its own projection.
    <li>Click off the menu item [ht::menu Projections {Auto-set Projection}], 
    so other data put in this display does not alter the projection.
    <li>Select a data source of model output, for the same time and area.
    <li>Make a display from the model analysis  
    of  wind barbs at upper air levels.
    <li>Use time animation, and viewpoint rotation, to compare the wind data
    from two sources.
  </ul>
</li>
