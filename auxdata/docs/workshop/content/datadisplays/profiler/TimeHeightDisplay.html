<div class="overview">
<p>
The Profiler Time/Height display shows profiler 
winds at all levels above one station, 
for one or more times. This is the conventional display of profiler data.
</p>
</div>

<p>

Winds are shown with the meteorological wind barb symbol. 
The location of the barb on the plot shows wind observation time, and 
height above mean sea level; the barb's orientation gives 
wind direction in a map view sense (up is north; right is east).

<P>

If necessary, select Profiler data and times as described in
[ht::popup "ProfilerDataLoading.html" "Loading Profiler Data"].
