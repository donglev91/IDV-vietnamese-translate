<title>Using the Time Animation Widget</title>

<div class="overview">
The [ht::popup TimeAnimationWidget.html {time animation widget}] in the 
IDV can be used to control the properties of a time loop.
</div>

<div class="cimg"><img src="images/AnimationWidget.gif" ></div>

<ol class="step">

  <li>Click on the dropdown box on the left side of the widget to 
      see the list of times that are in this display.  It will
      look something like this.</li>

<div class="cimg"><img src="images/AnimationTimes.gif" ></div>

  <li>Select the third time in the list to view the visualization for
      that time step.</li>

  <li>Loop through the entire animation by clicking the
      <img src="images/Play16.gif"> button on the animation widget.</li>

  <li>Stop the animation by clicking the
      <img src="images/Pause16.gif"> button.</li>

  <li>Return to the first time step by clicking the 
      <img src="images/Rewind16.gif"> button.</li>

  <li>Step forward through the animation one step at a time by 
      repeatedly clicking the <img src="images/StepForward16.gif"> button.</li>

  <li>Step backward through the animation one step at a time by 
      repeatedly clicking the <img src="images/StepBack16.gif"> button.</li>

  <li>Go to the last time step by clicking the 
      <img src="images/FastForward16.gif"> button.</li>

  <li>The row of boxes at the top of the widget 
      <img src="images/AnimationBoxes.gif"> is a visual indicator
      of the current position in the animation sequence.  
      Click on a box to go to that point in the sequence.</li>

  <li>You can also use the boxes to skip particular timesteps.  If you
      right click (MB3) on a box, it will turn red indicating that
      that step will be skipped.  Right click on a box and then 
      start the animation to see that the timestep is skipped.</li>

  <li>Open the <code class="dialog">Time Animation Properties</code> editor
      by clicking the <img src="images/Information16.gif"> button.

<div class="cimg"><img src="images/AnimationProperties.gif" ></div>

    <ul class="substep">
      <li>Change <code class="command">Direction</code> to rock back and 
          forth by selecting the [ht::command Rocking] option from
          the dropdown list and then click the [ht::button Apply]
          button.</li>

      <li>Start the animation.  When the loop reaches the last time step,
          the animation steps backward.  When it reaches the first time,
          it goes forward again.</li>

      <li>Set the <code class="command">First dwell</code>
          to be the same value as the <code class="command">Last dwell</code>,
          and then click the <code class="button">Apply</code> button to
          see the effect.</li>

      <li>Set the [ht::command Direction] back to [ht::command Forward].

    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

You can also define your own time animation under the 
[ht::tab Define Animation Times] tab.  We'll look at that in
a later exercise.
