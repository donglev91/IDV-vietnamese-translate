<title>Data Selection Overview</title>
<meta name="description" content="The data selection process 
involves adding a new Data Source to the IDV,
choosing a field to display and selecting the manner in which you wish
to display it.">

In the IDV, the process of analyzing and visualizing data takes the 
following steps:

<ol class="step">

  <li>Loading in a <code class="dataset">Data Source</code>.</li>

  <li>Selecting the parameter or diagnostic formula to use 
      for the display.</li>

  <li>Selecting the type of display (and optionally selecting
      a range of times, levels and spatial subsets).

  <li>Creating the display.

</ol>

<p>In the following sections, we will examine this process in
more detail.
