<ol class="step">

  <li>Load in the [ht::command {Davenport Radar}] bundle from the
      [ht::menu Workshop] favorites.  Use the [ht::param CCS039] 
      group in the RAOB chooser to select
      data from the Comet Case Study data that we used in previous
      exercises.  Select soundings from Davenport, Iowa (74455)
      for 1998-06-29 12:00:00Z and 1998-06-30 00:00:00Z. Compare
      the soundings to the meteorological situation shown by the
      radar.</li>

  <li>Create a plan view display of 500 mb parameters for 00Z today.
      Overlay the contours of 500 mb geopotential heights from the 
      initial time step of the 00Z NAM grid.</li>

  <li>Load in the latest 12Z RUC model data.  Create a 
      [ht::display Grid Skew-T] display.  Load in several 12Z soundings
      scattered over the model domain and create Skew-T displays of 
      the data.  Compare the model soundings with the observed soundings.</li>
</ol>
