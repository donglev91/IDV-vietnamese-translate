Upper Air RAOB sounding data can be accessed and displayed in the IDV as 
skew-T log-p, Stuve or Emagram displays, with a table of
aerological values.  More than one station and more than one sounding 
at each station can be loaded at once.

<ol class="step">

<li>Open the RAOB Data Source Chooser and Select a Time</li>
  <ul class="substep">

    <li>Click on [ht::button Connect].
    <li>The IDV will connect to the ADDE server at adde.ucar.edu and
    download metadata about available RAOB data. Data times you can get 
    from this server are listed in the box [ht::command Available Times:].
    <li>Select the 00 and 12 times for today.</li>
  </ul>

<li>Zooming and Decluttering the Selector, and Selecting Stations</li>
  <ul class="substep">
    <li>The map only shows a few stations, so you need to zoom in 
    and  declutter. [ht::mapSelector] 
     More stations will appear when you zoom in and declutter. 
     Find station 72201 (Key West) southwest of Miami, Florida. 
     <li>Click on that station. It will turn red, 
    and it will be listed with the data times in the 
    [ht::command Selected Soundings:] box.

    Ctrl key and clicking on 72214. Both stations now should be red.

</OL>

<p>

You should see the label [ht::command RAOB data: adde.ucar.edu] in the
[ht::command Data Sources] panel in the [ht::dialog Field Selector]. 
If the [ht::command Create display] checkbox was selected in the
chooser, the data will be read from the server and a 
[ht::display Skew-T] display will be created.  If not then
create it:

<ul class="step">

    <li>In the [ht::dialog Field Selector] window create a 
     [ht::display RAOB Skew-T] display using 
     the [ht::param RAOB Data] field.</li>
</ul>
<p>

The skew-T plot appears in its own control window in the
[ht::dialog Dashboard], with the data 
from the first station and time plotted.
Skew-T plots of RAOB data have a station selector box
labeled [ht::command Soundings].   Undock the 
[ht::display Skew-T] control from the Dashboard with the
[ht::menu View {Undock from Dashboard}] menu.

       table are all in the control window.
