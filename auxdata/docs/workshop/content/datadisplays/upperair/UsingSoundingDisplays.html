Using the IDV Sounding Display

<p>

The temperature and dew-point traces can be modified via the cursor.
Press the left button on the first data-point to be modified and drag
it horizontally along an isobar to the desired position, then move the
pointer diagonally along an isotherm to keep the data-point at the
desired position and to pick-up the next data-point. Repeat until done
and then release the mouse button.

<p>

The check box labeled [ht::command Parcel mode] selects the origin of
the path of a parcel of air lifted pseudo-adiabatically from the initial
point to the top of the diagram. Check [ht::command Parcel path] to
display the path of a lifted parcel.

<p>

The initial conditions of the pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel
  (i.e. the parcel's pressure, temperature, and moisture content at
  the start of the pseudo-adiabatic lifting) are determined from the
  environmental sounding (i.e. the temperature and dew-point profiles)
  according to the mode indicated by [ht::command Parcel mode].  The modal
  choices are 
  <b>Bottom of Sounding</b>, 
  <b>Below Cursor</b>, 
  <b>At Cursor Pressure</b>, and 
  <b>At Cursor (Press, Temp)</b>.
  <p>
  In <b>Bottom of Sounding</b> mode, the initial conditions of the
  parcel are determined from the temperature and
  dew-point at the lowest (i.e. highest pressure) data-point of the
  environmental profiles.
  <p>
  In <b>Below Cursor</b> mode, the initial conditions
  of the parcel are determined from the temperature and dew-point
  profiles by computing the pressure-weighted mean potential temperature
  and water-vapor mixing-ratio of the atmosphere that lies below the
  cursor when the middle mouse button is pressed.
  Thus, pressing the middle button 
  at 950 hPa for a sounding that starts at 1000 hPa will effectively
  mix the lower 50 hPa of the atmosphere and lift the resulting parcel
  starting at 975 hPa.
  <p>
  In <b>At Cursor Pressure</b> mode,
  the initial pressure, in-situ temperature, and moisture content of the parcel
  are taken from the the temperature and dew-point profiles at the pressure of
  the cursor when the middle mouse button is pressed.
  <p>
  In <b>At Cursor (Press, Temp)</b> mode,
  the initial pressure and in-situ temperature of the parcel equal
  the pressure and temperature values under the cursor 
  when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The initial
  moisture content is determined from the dew-point profile at the
  initial pressure.

<p>

The computed path of a lifted parcel is automatically updated when
  appropriate. In 
  <b>Below Cursor</b>, 
  <b>At Cursor Pressure</b>, and 
  <b>At Cursor (press, temp)</b> modes, the
  path will update as the cursor is dragged.  In all modes, the path
  will update whenever the profiles change.

<p>

The check box labeled [ht::command Virtual Temperature] controls whether
or not the virtual temperatures of the environmental profile and
pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel are displayed.

<p>

The check box labeled [ht::command Spatial Loci] controls whether or not
the location of the sounding data is displayed in the main, 3-D window.
For aircraft data, the track of the aircraft will be displayed; for RAOB
data, the locations of the stations will be displayed; and for gridded
data, the grid points will be displayed.

<p>

The table to the left of the sounding diagram contains aerological
  parameters determined from the atmospheric sounding displayed in the
  diagram.  The following abbreviations are used:
  <dl>
    <dt>LCL</dt>
    <dd>
      Lifting Condensation Level: the level at which a
      pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel becomes saturated with
      water-vapor.
    </dd>
    <dt>LFC</dt>
    <dd>
      Level of Free Convection: the level at which the virtual
      temperature of a pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel changes
      from being less than the environment's virtual temperature to
      being greater than the environment's.
    </dd>
    <dt>LNB</dt>
    <dd>
      Level of Neutral Buoyancy: the level above the LFC at which the
      virtual temperature of a pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel
      equals the environment's virtual temperature.
    </dd>
    <dt>CAPE</dt>
    <dd>
      Convective Available Potential Energy: the area between the
      virtual temperature trace of the pseudo-adiabatically lifted
      air-parcel and the virtual temperature trace of the environment
      from the LFC to the LNB in which the parcel's virtual temperature
      is greater than the environment's (positive CAPE connotes
      convective development).
    </dd>
    <dt>CIN</dt>
    <dd>
      Convective Inhibition: the negative of the area between the
      virtual temperature trace of the pseudo-adiabatically lifted
      air-parcel and the virtual temperature trace of the environment
      from the parcel's initial conditions to the LFC in which the
      parcel's virtual temperature is less than the environment's
      (negative CIN connotes initial positive work to lift the parcel).
