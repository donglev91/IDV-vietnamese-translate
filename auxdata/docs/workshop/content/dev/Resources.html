<div class="overview">

<ul>
<li> The IDV  knows very little about everything. All of the things that
make up an application are defined by a set of resources. This includes:
<ul>
<li> The user interface skins, menu bar, toolbar.
<li> The data choosers, what data sources are available, formulas and derived quantities.
<li> What displays are available and the  the display resources: color tables, station models, display conventions, etc.
<li> ...
</ul>

<li> The resources are defined at startup time by the <i>idv.resourcefiles</i> property. This 
points to a list of &quot;rbi&quot; files:
<pre>idv.resourcefiles=%USERPATH%/idv.rbi;%SITEPATH%/idv.rbi;%APPPATH%/idv.rbi;%IDVPATH%/idv.rbi</pre>

<li> By default the IDV looks in the USERPATH, SITEPATH, APPPATH and the IDVPATH for the RBI files and loads them in 
that order.

<li> Let's go look at the system idv.rbi file in ucar/unidata/idv/resources/idv.rbi
<ul>
<li> The RBI is made up of a number of resources tags, each one defines where the IDV can find the
resources files for that particular resource. e.g., by default the xml files that define the
color tables are found in:
[ug::xml {
  <resources name="idv.resource.colortables">
    <resource location="%USERPATH%/colortables.xml"/>
    <resource location="%SITEPATH%/colortables.xml"/>
    <resource location="%APPPATH%/colortables.xml"/>
    <resource location="%IDVPATH%/colortables.xml"/>
  </resources>
}]

<li> The resource locations can point to different things, not just xml files. It just so happens
that most of the resource files are defined using xml.

</ul>

<li> In a later section we'll see how to control what resources get loaded when using the &quot;loadmore=false&quot; attribute.

<li> Let's look at the resources in more detail.
<ul>
<li> Run the ExampleIdv  with the argument -listresources to see the list of resources and which
ones exist.
<li> The X'ed red ones are those that don't exist. The green ones exist.
<li> The pattern is used for recognizing resources in a plugin.
<li> Note, the paths can be a Java resource, a file or a url. The IDV handles all of these transparently.
<li> Let's create a couple of things - a new color table, a new station model and a new formula.
<li> Shut down and restart with -listresources again.
</ul>

<li> Let's look at the local IDV storage directory.
<ul>
<li> cd to  ~/.unidata/idv/DefaultIdv 
<li> This directory holds everything created by the user in the ExampleIdv. Its name comes from
idv.store.name property.
<li> Note, there should be  colortables.xml, stationmodels.xml and derived.xml files  there. These hold the resources
you created previously.
<li> These can be used in a site path or within a plugin.
</ul>

</ul>
