<title>Creating a Weather Text Data Chooser</title>


<div class="overview">
Let's see how we can access weather text bulletins from an ADDE server.
</div>

<ol>
<li>Start the Example IDV
<li>From the Dashboard, select the [ht::command {Data Chooser}] tab.
<li>Select the [ht::command URLs] Chooser.  The IDV can use
the ADDE URL syntax to access weather text on a remote server.
<li>Paste the following URL into the
text box:
<pre>
adde://adde.ucar.edu/wxtext?apro=zfp&amp;astn=mkx
</pre>
and click the [ht::command {Add Source}] button.
<li>In this case, the IDV handles the URL as an input stream and
by default displays it in the TextDisplayControl.  However, having to
type in an obscure URL syntax is not the ultimate User Interface.
<li>Exit the IDV.
</ol>
Let's create a chooser that allows the user to select from some
predefined products.
<ol>
<li> cd  to <i><%workshop.installdir%>/ucar/unidata/apps/example</i>
<li>Open <code>WxTextChooser.java</code> in an editor and let's look what's
there.
<li>Exit the editor and compile the class
<li>Copy chooser.xml from the <i>resources</i> directory to the current
directory.
[ht::cmdline {cp resources/chooser.xml .}]
<li>
Open the file in an editor and look at what's defined.
<li>Exit the editor.
<li>Start the IDV.
<li>From the Dashboard, select the [ht::command {Data Chooser}] tab.
Notice that our chooser is there.  Select a server, product and station
and click the [ht::command {Add Source}] button.  Try this with different
products.  If you know some  codes and station ids, try them as well.
<li>Now let's look at having a custom Data Source to handle our
data.
</ol>
