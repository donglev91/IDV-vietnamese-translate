<div class="overview">
<p>
Formulas can be used to do simple arithmetic such as the simple difference, 
or they can be used to call Jython procedures as in the previous excercise. 
They can also be used to call Java methods and nest Jython procedures.  In
this exercise, we will show how to create more complex formulas from the
set of diagnostic functions in the IDV.

<ol class="step">

<li>Calculating the ageostrophic wind
  <ul class="substep">
    <li>Clear all displays and data.
    <li>[ht::loadEtaGrid]
    <li>Create the following displays:
        <ul>
        <li>500 mb contours of geopotential height
        <li>500 mb flow vectors of grid relative winds.  Set the skip interval 
         to 2 and the range to be -30 to 30.  Save the display settings 
         as [ht::param {Workshop-&gt;Flow fields}].
        <li>500 mb flow vectors of the geostrophic wind.  Use the 
        display settings saved in the previous step.
        </ul>
    <li>The ageostropic wind is the difference between the geostropic wind 
    and the actual wind.

   <ul><pre>AGEO = OBS - GEO</pre></ul>
    
    <li>We could simply create a formula that is OBS - GEO and select the
    flow vector field and the geostropic wind.  For this exercise, we will 
    look at how we can do this from the basic fields, on the fly.  
    <li>Open the Jython Library and look at the 
    [ht::menu System {Grid Diagnostics}] library.  This is a set 
    of diagnostic functions that can be applied to 
    grids.  The names closely match the set of grid diagnostics in GEMPAK.
    Look at the page in the 
    <a href="[ht::ug::url {/tools/JythonLib.html}]" target="userguide">
    Jython Library</a> section of the User's Guide.  
    <li>From the Formulas Data Source, select the 
    [ht::menu Grids {Define a grid diagnostic}] formula.
    <li>Select the [ht::menu {Flow Displays} {Vector Plan View}], 
    the [ht::param {Workshop-&gt;Flow fields}] display 
    setting and create the display. 
    <li>You will be prompted for the formula. In the dialog, type in:

    <ul><pre><b> vsub(vecr(u,v),geo(z)) </b></pre></ul>

     This will take the vector difference (<b>vsub</b>) between the vector 
     (<b>vecr</b>) defined by <b>u</b> and <b>v</b> components and the 
     geostrophic wind (<b>geo</b>) calculated from the geopotential 
     height field (<b>z</b>).
     <li>Click the [ht::button OK] button.
     <li>For the fields, select the u and v wind components and the 
     geopotential height for u,v and z respectively.  Select the 500 hPa level
     for each of the grids.
     <li>Zoom in to see the detail of the plots.
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Calculating the magnitude of the ageostrophic wind</li>
<ul>
     <li>The magnitude (speed) of the ageostrophic wind can be calulated using 
     the mag function.  To save some steps, we'll save the ageostropic wind
     field in the cache and use that.
     <li>Use the ageostrophic vector control's 
     [ht::menu File Save {Save Data in Cache}] menu to save the data in
     the cache.  You can leave the name as is or change it to ageo.
     <li>Select the [ht::menu Grid {Create a grid diagnostic}] formula
     and the Contour Plan View Display.
     <li>In the dialog, type:
     <ul><pre><b>mag(v)</b></pre></ul>
     <li>For the field, select the cached data.

</ul>
</ol>
