[ht::desc How to Create and Use Jython-based Computations]



You have seen how to compute wind speed from u and v wind components,
using the [ht::popup "../formulas/SimpleFormulas.html" "Formulas"]
facility. IDV formulas are actually code in the Jython language. If your
calculations require more than a one-line mathematical expression you
can create Jython methods to make calculations then you can call these
methods in a formula. Here is an example of computing wind speed with a
four-line method.


<ol class="step">

<li>Invoking the Jython Library and Editor</li>
  <ul class="substep">
    <li>
    Click on the main menu item 
    [ht::menu Edit Formulas {Jython Library}]
    to bring up the  [ht::dialog Jython Libraries] Editor
  </ul>
</li>



<p>The Jython Library window has two or more panes selected by the tabs
at the top. Only the &quot;User's Library&quot is editable; the others
came from the site path and system defaults.</p>

<popup label="How to Edit in the Jython Library">
The user library pane is an editor window you can type in. It
uses simple mouse actions to move the insertion point and 
mark areas for cut and paste. Drag the mouse to highlight; use the
delete or backspace key
to remove highlighted text, and middle mouse button to paste.

<details link="How to write a Jython Method">
<p>
 A Jython method starts with the word <b>def</b>. The first line
includes the method name and argument list, and <b>ends with a
colon</b>. Method names are, by convention, descriptive with each first
letter of a word in upper case, except the first letter in the method name
is always lower case.  Using this convention means others can use
your code with less trouble. Do not omit the final colon 
on this line.
<p>
Method documentation, which is optional but highly
recommended, is enclosed in sets of triple quotes beginning in the
first line
after "def." with first line setting the indent level for the
method.   Regular comment lines begin with #, and can be located anywhere.
<p>
Code blocks correspond to the same level of indentation, such as
the code block in these methods. There is no extra end-of-line
character. There  is no declaration of new variables, you simply use variables
as needed and the type of data is deduced by Jython from the context.
<p>
Indentation must be the same in Jython code blocks or it will not
run, or fail to run correctly. 
How many spaces you use for a code block indent is
up to you, but must be one or more spaces.
<p>
Jython syntax is checked when you save the file. If there is an
error, a pop-up window will appear with the message <b>An exception has
occurred writing in Jython library</b>. The actual error will also be
printed in the console window running the IDV. Correct the error and
try to save again.
<p>
Common Jython errors include irregular indentation, and omitting the colon from
the end of for, if, and def statements.
<p>
Note that you can cut and paste from the Jython Library Editor to the 
formula editor. Keeping the Jython Library Editor open while creating
formulas is handy.

<details link="Jython Methods and the IDV">
<p>
In any Jython method in the IDV
  the operands and results can be used for single values, 
multidimensional arrays, or any other data object supported by the IDV
and VisAD, depending on the type of the incoming data.
<p>
The example simple method is so short it would have been easier to
simply type it as one line formula. But any method  can be called by
other methods in the library, or by formulas. There is no limit on how long your
methods can be.
<p>
Your personal Jython library is stored in a file named 
[ht::filename default.py] in your home
directory or in a directory under the home directory, 
usually in [ht::filename ~/.unidata/idv/DefaultIdv/default.py]
on UNIX systems.
This one file keeps all your Jython methods.
<p>The Jython Library Editor automatically imports the methods in 
visad.python.JPythonMethods. You can use them simply by typing the
method names in your methods.
<p>
Check out the methods in the system Jython library to see if they
are of use to you. These methods also show some examples of calling
IDV internal code.

<P>

<li>Defining your own Jython Method</li>
  <ul class="substep">
    <LI>In the  [ht::dialog Jython libraries] Editor, click on the tab
    [ht::command User's Library]
    <li>Create a new Jython method called windSpeed(u,v).
    Jython methods have a first line beginning with "def" and 
    ending with the colon ":". The code block composing the method must 
    be indented at least one space. Indentation must be the same for 
    all line in a code block, except continued comment lines which
    are set off with triple quotes.
    Your code block will be something like:

<ul><pre> 
def  windSpeed(u,v):
     """  compute wind speed from u and v
          wind components """
     usqd= u*u
     vsqd= v*v
     ws = sqrt(usqd + vsqd)
     return ws
</pre></ul>
    
   <li>Click on [ht::button Save] to check for correct Jython syntax
   and save the method; 
   you will get an 
   error message if the syntax is not correct. 
   If it is complete, your method is saved.
   <li>Use the [ht::menu File Close] menu to exit the editor.
 </ul>
</li>


<li>Use the Method in a Formula</li>
  <ul class="substep">
    <LI>Leave up your previous display made with formulas, and 
    the same data source.

    <li> From the main menu, click on 
    [ht::menu Edit Formulas {Create Formula}].
    The [ht::dialog Formula Editor] window appears. 

    <li>Enter the [ht::command Name] [ht::param jythonWS].

    <li>
    Enter the method for the formula definition in the 
    [ht::command Formula] entry field, simply
    [ht::command windSpeed(u,v)].


    <li> Open the [ht::command Advanced] panel by clicking on the down arrow.

    <li>Enter the [ht::command Description] 
    &quot;jython wind speed&quot;.

    <li>For 
    [ht::command Group] select [ht::param Workshop] from the 
    drop down list.

    <li>In the 
    [ht::command Displays] section, click on 
    [ht::command Use selected] and then the [ht::command All off]
    radio button.  Then select [ht::command Contour Plan View] and 
    [ht::command Contour Vertical Cross Section] in the list.

    <li>Click on [ht::button Add Formula]. 

    <li>An item  [ht::param jython wind speed] 
    should appear in the 
    [ht::dialog Field Selector] window's [ht::command Fields] panel, under
    the [ht::param Workshop] category.

    <li>Use the formula to  make a contour display
    of wind speed using the same u and v wind components 
    from the previous exercise.

    <li>Check to see if the results appear reasonable.

 </ul>
</li>
