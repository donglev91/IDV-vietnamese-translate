[ht::desc How to Create and Use IDV Formulas]

<p>

Formulas in the IDV are one-line mathematical expressions
to derive new values from data available. 
<!--
Different data sources can be used in one formula,
and interpolation and remapping are done automatically when necessary.
-->

<P>

The IDV comes with some Formulas. Here is an example of using one.

<p>

<ol class="step">
<li>Using an IDV System Formula</li>
  <ul class="substep">
    <LI>[ht::loadEtaGrid]
    <li>Load in the 
    [ht::filename ETA 1998-06-29 12:00] data source, so we have 
    two output times from the Eta model, 12 hours apart.
    <li>In the [ht::dialog Field Selector], select
    [ht::param Formulas] in the
    [ht::command Data Sources] panel. Click on the 
    [ht::param Miscellaneous] tag in the [ht::command Fields] panel
    <li>Right-click on [ht::param Simple difference a-b],
    then click on [ht::command Edit Formula] in the popup menu.
    The [ht::dialog Formula Editor] appears.
    (For more see 
    <details link="Formula Editor"> 
     The [ht::command Name] 
     is a short name used for the legend labels on displays.  
    <P>
    Enter the mathematical formula definition 
    after [ht::command Formula]. 
    <P>
    IDV uses the Jython language for formulas.
    Jython supports such common mathematical operators as
    +, -, *, /, and ** (for exponentiation). 
    Rules of precedence apply, for example, 1.5*T*W**2 is 
    the same as (1.5*T) * (W**2).
    <p>
    To perform common mathematical operations on two gridded VisAD objects a and b, we recommend user to
    use the corresponding grid diagnostic formulas: add(a,b), sub(a,b), mul(a,b), and quo(a,b). This
    can be less problematic. The simple different formula a-b in this exercise is calling sub(a, b).
    <P>
    The variable names in the formula definition are arbitrary place 
    holders. Do not use 
    names with  spaces such as "wind speed." Start each variable name 
    with a letter.
    <p>
    The advanced section allows you to define a lengthier description, a group
    and what displays to use.
    <p>The [ht::command Description]  appears in the 
    [ht::dialog Field Selector] window. If nothing is entered here, 
    the formula name (above) is reused for a description.
    <p>A  
    [ht::command Group] will create a new  
    (and optional) group in the 
    [ht::dialog Field Selector] window under [ht::command Formulas]. 
    It can be any normal text including spaces, numbers, and punctuation 
    characters, such as "moisture parameters" or 
    "two level profiler difference, English units."  
    You do not need to enter a group. 
    <p>In the 
    [ht::command Displays] section, either accept the default 
    [ht::command Use all], or select the [ht::command Use selected]  
    button and click off the displays that this formula's result will 
    not support.  For example, a field of wind vectors does not need 
    to have a display choice of Isosurface. 
    </details>).
    <li>Click [ht::command Cancel] in the [ht::dialog Formula Editor].
 </ul>
</li>

<li>Requesting the Formula to be Computed and Displayed</li>
  <ul class="substep">   
    <li> In the
    [ht::dialog Displays] panel expand the Plan Views tab and click on 
    [ht::display Contour Plan View], then click on 
    [ht::button Create Display].
    <li>A [ht::dialog Field Selector] 
    window appears that allows you to select which actual 
    parameters from a data source or sources you want to use 
    for each variable in the formula. 
    You can select parameters from more than one data source 
    for use in this single formula. 
    <li>In the [ht::dialog Field Selector]
    window:<br>
    For the &quot;a&quot; operand choose:<br>
    [ht::dataset {Eta 1998-06-29 12:00 -&gt; 2D Grid -&gt; mean sea level pressure (Eta model reduction)}]
    <p>
    For the &quot;b&quot; operand  choose:<br>
    [ht::dataset {Eta 1998-06-29 00:00 -&gt; 2D Grid -&gt; mean sea level pressure (Eta model reduction)}]

    <li>Click on [ht::button OK]. 

    <li>Grids of twelve hour MSL pressure difference values 
    are computed using the formula,  and the result shown in the 
    main view window. 

    <li>Look at the contours and see if the values are reasonable. 
    (What are the units?). 
  </ul>
</li>

<p>
You can make your own formulas. Your formulas are saved so you can build a 
library of your own derived quantities, using data you have.

<b>Notes on formulas</b>
<p>

The [ht::command Description] is listed in the 
[ht::dialog {Field Selector}]'s [ht::command Fields] panel.
If you leave the [ht::command Description] field empty, the name
of the formula will be used as the description.  

<p>

[ht::command Group] is a way of categorizing your formulas and
is optional.
If the [ht::command Group] does not already exist, it is added when
you save the new formula. If the [ht::command Group] already exists,
the new formula will appear under that group's tab in the 
[ht::dialog {Field Selector}]'s [ht::command Fields] panel. If you 
leave the [ht::command Group] empty, the formula appears in the 
list directly. 

<p>

The variable names in the formula definition, such as dpt, are dummy
names, and in principle can be anything, such as "a" or "var2".
It is best to use variable names that suggest the parameter data
they represent so that later in the parameter selection step you
remember what the variables should represent. Use names like Temp500m,
RelHum_surf, absvort, sst_jan, or whatever makes sense to you. If
you use a variable names like V1 and V2, then later when the formula
requests which real parameter name goes with which dummy variable name
you may be puzzled.

<p>

Once you have defined a formula, it is saved and will appear in future
runs of your IDV. It is saved in your personal copy of the derived.xml
file, which usually is in the file 
[ht::filename ~/.unidata/idv/DefaultIdv/derived.xml]
on UNIX systems. 

<p>

Holding the mouse pointer stationary over the formula name in the       
[ht::dialog Field Selector]'s [ht::dialog Fields] panel will cause a    
tooltip box to appear showing the formula name and the mathematical formula.                   

<p>

Formulas are preserved by the IDV. Next time you start the IDV you will see
formulas you created before. You can build up a library of your own formulas.

<p>

To remove a formula, click on 
[ht::command Remove formula] in the [ht::dialog Field Selector]'s
formula pull down menu. 
This does not remove a display of calculations made with a formula, it removes
the formula itself from the 
[ht::dialog Field Selector] window. Usually you leave formulas
in place until you are sure you will not use them again.
