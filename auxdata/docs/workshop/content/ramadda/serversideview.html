Publishing via Server-Side Publication

<p>RAMADDA has the ability to provide a view of the file system on which RAMADDA is installed. In order give users this file system view, we must first provide RAMADDA with the permissions necessary to view the file system.</p>

<ol class="step">
<li>Login with your admin credentials.</li>
<li>Select the "Admin" tab and "Settings" sub-tab and open the "Access" Node. In the "File system access" area, enter the <code>/home/idv/idvData</code> directory.</li>
<div class="cimg"><img src="images/serversideview.gif" ></div>
<li>Navigate to the <a href ="http://localhost:8080/repository/entry/show/RAMADDA+Data+Repository/Data">RAMADDA data directory</a>.</li>
<li>Create new entry and select "Server Side Files".</li>
<div class="cimg"><img src="images/serversideview1.gif" ></div>
<li>Supply a name and a "Server file path" of <code>/home/idv/idvData</code>.</li>
<div class="cimg"><img src="images/serversideview2.gif" ></div>
