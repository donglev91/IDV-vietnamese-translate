<div class="overview">
Creating Users and Roles
</div>

<p>Now that you have set up the RAMADDA admin account, you are ready to set up users and roles.</p>

<ol class="step">
<li>In RAMADDA, select the Admin tab and Users subtab and click "New User"</li>
<div class="cimg"><img src="images/user.gif" ></div>
<li>Create one or multiple users as well as roles. A role authorizes a user to perform certain operations within RAMADDA. For the purposes of this exercise, create an "IDV" role, in the "Roles" text area. Also select a "Home folder" in the "Users" folder by clicking on the "Select" link at the bottom. This home folder creation is important as we will be using it later.</li>
<div class="cimg"><img src="images/usercreate.gif" ></div>
<li>Please logout of your admin account.</li>
<div class="cimg"><img src="images/logout.gif" ></div>

</ol>

<p>You are now ready to start <a href="idvpub.html">publishing data</a> via the IDV</p>
