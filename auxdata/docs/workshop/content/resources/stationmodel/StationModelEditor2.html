[ht::desc More on the Layout Model Editor]

<div class="overview">
Let's find out why there isn't anything displayed.
</div>



<ol class="step">
  
  <li>Bring up the [ht::filename Workshop] layout model again.
      
  <ul class="substep">
    
    <li>Open up the [ht::dialog Layout Model Editor] from the [
        ht::menu Tools {Layout Model Editor}]  menu.</li>
    
    <li>Bring up the [ht::dialog Properties] dialog for the
        symbol by right clicking on it and selecting the
        [ht::menu {Properties...}] menu item.</li>
    
    <li>Note that the name of the parameter we are using is [ht::qt IDN].</li>
    
    <li>Press the [ht::button Cancel] button to close the dialog.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <li>Now, back to the [ht::display Point Data Plot] control window let's
      see what parameters are available in the data set.</li>
  
  <ul class="substep">
    
    <li> Look at the [ht::command Details] tab in the [ht::command Properties Dialog] for the Point Data Source (accessed via the [ht::command Field Selector] tab on the Dashboard).

    <li>Note there is no [ht::param IDN] field. However, there is an
        [ht::param   ID]  field in the data.</li>
    
    <li>Close the [ht::dialog Properties] window.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <li>Once again,  back to the [ht::dialog Layout Model Editor].</li>
  
  <ul class="substep">
    
    <li>Bring up the [ht::dialog Properties] dialog for the symbol.</li>
    
    <li> Click on the <img src="DownDown.gif"> button to bring up the list of 
    all parameter names. Look for and select the  [ht::qt ID] parameter under the point data.
<p>
    <popup label="A note on the data source name">
As an aside notice the really long name for the data source. 
Its too late to change it in this menu but we could  change the name
in the [ht::command Properties] dialog for the data source.
</popup>

</li>


    <li>Aha! We were using the [ht::param IDN] when we should have been using
        the [ht::param ID], the IACO Station ID.</li>
    
    <li>Select that parameter. Notice that the parameters can be a comma separated list.  Click the [ht::button OK] button and save
        the layout model (select [ht::menu File Save]).</li>
    
    <li>You should now see the station identifiers  in the display.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <li> Now, how do we handle the case where  
we have lots of layout models for data that 
has &quot;ID&quot; like fields and then we encounter data with some other
field name, e.g., &quot;the_station_id&quot;? Do we go and change each and 
every model? The answer is thankfully no! See the <a href=../../config/ParameterAliasEditor.html>Alias Editor</a> for more information.

  </ul>



</ul>

<li> Now, let's spend some time in building some other layout models.

<ul>
<li>Start fresh. [ht::refresh]
<li> Go to the CONUS projection with the [ht::menu Projections Predefined US CONUS] menu item.
<li> Load in US city locations with the [ht::menu Displays Locations {US} {U.S. Cities}] menu item.
<li> Select the [ht::button Layout Model] button.
<li> Edit the [ht::command Location] layout model.
<li> Try adding a [ht::command Shape] shape.
<li> Select some shape and press [ht::button Apply]
<li> The location has a [ht::param pop] attribute. Try scaling the shape this value. 
<ul>
<li> Go to the [ht::command Scale Size By] tab in the [ht::dialog Properties Dialog]
<li> Enter [ht::param pop] for the parameter.
<li> In [ht::command Data Range] enter 1000000 in the second field.
<li> Enter some scale range. e.g., 0.5-5.0
<li> Press [ht::button Apply]
</ul>

<li> Try doing a color by [ht::param pop]
</ul>





</ol>
