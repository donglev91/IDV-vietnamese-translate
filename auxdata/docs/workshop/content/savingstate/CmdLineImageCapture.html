<title>Command Line Image Capture</title>



<div class="overview">
In this section we will cover how to automatically capture JPEG images from the command line.
</div>

<ol class="step">

  <li>To automatically capture a JPEG image from the command line we will use the bundle we created previously.</li>
  <li>Exit the IDV if it is running and run the following command:
<pre>
    runIDV -image test.jpg <%workshop.homedir%>/workshop.xidv
</pre>

<li>You should see the IDV start up, load in the bundle and then exit.</li>

<li>You should have the [ht::filename test.jpg] file created in the local directory.</li>

<li>Caveats:</li>
<ul class="substep">
   <li> Bug: Capturing the image before the display is fully created.</li>
   <li> The IDV needs to have a display to capture images.</li>
   <li> Start-up time. </li>
</ul>
</ol>
