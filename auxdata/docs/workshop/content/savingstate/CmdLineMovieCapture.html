<ol class="step">

  <li>To automatically capture a QuickTime movie from the command 
  line we will use the [ht::filename movie.xidv] bundle we created previously.</li>
  <li>Exit the IDV if it is running and run the following command:
<pre>
    runIDV -movie test.mov <%workshop.homedir%>/movie.xidv
</pre>

<li>You should see the IDV start up, load in the bundle and then exit.</li>

<li>You should have the test.mov file created in the local directory.</li>


</ol>
