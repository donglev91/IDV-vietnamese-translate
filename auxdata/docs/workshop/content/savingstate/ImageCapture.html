<title>Image Capture</title>



<div class="overview">
In this section, we will cover how to capture images within the IDV.
</div>

<ol class="step">
  

  <li>If you have nothing displayed, then load in the bundle that we previously created.</li>
  <ul class="substep">
    <li>Select the [ht::menu File Open] menu item. In the [ht::dialog File Dialog]
        choose [ht::filename workshop.xidv] from your home directory.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <li>Select the [ht::menu View Capture {Image...}] menu item from
      the map view's   menu bar. The [ht::dialog File Dialog] will popup.</li>
  
  <li>The IDV requires that the window you are capturing an image in is not
      obscured. Move any other windows out of the way.</li>
  
  <li>You can save an image as a jpg, gif or png. [ht::save workshop.jpg]</li>
  
  <li> Let's capture the full window. From the File Dialog enter
[ht::filename fullwindow.png] and select the [ht::button Full Window] button on the left. 

  <li>The IDV treats image files as yet another data source. Load
      in the newly created images by:</li>
  
  <ul>
    
    <li>[ht::openDataSourceChooser]</li>
    
    <li>Go to the [ht::command Files] tab.</li>
    
    <li>Make sure you are in your home directory.</li>
    <li>Select [ht::filename workshop.jpg] and [ht::filename wholewindow.png] with a control-click</li>
  </ul>
  
  <li>Since images are not geo-located we can only display
      the  image in the [ht::display Omni Control]. Create this display.</li>

  <li> Now, let's save this image as a Google Earth kmz file.
  <ul>
      <li> When we capture an image for Google Earth we have to make sure we are using a Lat/Lon projection
      in an overhead view.
      <li> The easiest way to do that is to select the [ht::menu Projections {Use Displayed Area}] menu.
      <li> Select the [ht::menu View Capture {Image}] menu item and enter [ht::filename workshop.kmz]. 
      <li> A reminder is shown about the Lat/Lon projection.
      <li> From a terminal window bring up Google Earth and Open this kmz file.
  </ul>

 <li> The IDV can also read in Google Earth kml/kmz files.
 <ul> 
    <li> From the IDV Data Source Chooser select the [ht::filename workshop.kmz] file.
    <li> From the field selector create an Image display.
 </ul>


</ol>
