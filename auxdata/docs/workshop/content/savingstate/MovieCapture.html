<title>Movie Capture</title>


<div class="overview">
In this section we will cover how to create QuickTime movies, animated gifs and Goole Earth files
within the IDV.
</div>

<ol class="step">
  
  <li>First, load in some data with multiple time steps and create a
      display.</li>
  
  <ul class="substep">
    
    <li>Remove any data and displays. [ht::refresh]</li>
    
    <li>[ht::loadEtaGrid]</li>
    
    <li>[ht::createBasicDisplay]</li>
   
  </ul>
  
  <li>Save this state off as the [ht::qt movie] bundle.</li>
  <ul class="substep">
    <li> Select the [ht::menu File {Save As...}] menu item.</li>
    <li>Make sure you are in your home directory and enter [ht::filename movie.xidv].</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Open the [ht::dialog Movie Capture] window by
      selecting the [ht::menu View Capture {Movie}] menu item
      from the map view's   menu bar.</li>
  
  <li>For now the IDV requires that the window you are capturing an image in is
      not obscured.   Move any other windows  out of the way.</li>
  
  <li>A movie is simply a sequence of frames. There are three ways to capture
      this sequence.</li>
  
  <li>You can capture one frame with the [ht::button Capture one image]
      button.</li>
  
  <ul class="subsubstep">
    
    <li>Try 3 or 4 cycles of capturing one image and moving the viewpoint.</li>
    
    <li>You should see the [ht::command Frames] panel become enabled and the
        number  of frames listed.</li>
    
    <li>Bring up the [ht::dialog Movie Preview] window by clicking the
        [ht::button   Preview] button.</li>
    
    <li>In the [ht::dialog Movie Preview] window you can step forward, backward
        and play the movie as well as delete individual frames.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <li>Start fresh by clicking the [ht::button Delete all] button in the main
      [ht::dialog Movie Capture] window.</li>
  




  <li>Now, let's capture an entire animation by clicking the
      [ht::button Capture Time Animation] button.</li>
  
  <li>When the animation is complete the [ht::dialog File Dialog] will automatically
be shown. [ht::save workshop.mov]</li>
  

  <li>The [ht::button Capture automatically] button allows
      you to capture a single frame every <i>N</i> seconds.</li>
      <ul class="substep">
         <li>Click the [ht::button Capture automatically] button to start the capture.</li>
         <li>Turn on animation.</li>
         <li>Navigate around the 3D view. Zooming in, etc.</li>
         <li>Click the [ht::button Stop] button and then click [ht::button Preview].</li>
         <li>The [ht::dialog Preview] window allows you to view, play and delete the frames
         that make up a movie.
      </ul>
  
  <li>The IDV treats QuickTime movies as yet another data source. Load in
      and view the newly created movie by:</li>
  
  <ul>
    
    <li>[ht::openDataSourceChooser]</li>
    
    <li>Go to the [ht::command Files] tab.</li>
    
    <li>Select [ht::filename workshop.mov].</li>
    

    <li> For Quicktime movies the data source is not shown and the  [ht::display Movie Display Control] will automatically be created.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <li> You can also save the movie as a Google Earth kmz file.
  <ul>
     <li> Press the [ht::button Delete All] button.
     <li> Capture the animation with the [ht::button Capture   animation] button.
     <li> When done, choose [ht::filename movie.kmz] as the file.
     <li> Bring this file up in Google Earth.
  </ul>
  
</ul>
</ol>
