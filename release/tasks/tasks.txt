List of IDV Bugs/Enhancements collected from workshops, user inquiries, and talking to users.

==Bugs==

* cached data does not remember time subsetting
* dual monitor support doesn't work well.
* decluttering with station names (or text glyphs in general) doesn't work
* well in the  station model/location controls
* color scales and labels sometimes disappear when loaded from a bundle.
* Satellite image does not show up in NEXRCOMP projection (VisAD bug)
* View->Capture->Print function doesn't work well
* Radar Cross Section and RHI don't work in the globe display
* make2D with a slice (to ignore the vertical dimension) doesn't give a slider in the plan view display
* Barnes does not handle missing data well.  Radius of influence seems not to be setting values to NaN.
* Values in text fields in the LocationIndicatorControl don't handle localization.
* Cross sections through WRF native grids are usually empty
* charts have problems with dates.  See Inquiry AHX-540298
* can't load sounding data from NOMADs servers because they don't support units.  NCEP is supposed to be working on this, but is put on hold for new development
* Stop loads doesn't really stop loads, needs to do more better
* loading stations when zoomed has scaling issues

== Enhancements==

===Views===

* Tabbed browsing.  Load bundles into tab groups.
* Finish making all displays work well in the globe view.

===Displays ===

* meteorograms
* charts
* Flow visualization; Lagrangian vis:
    ** balls, streamers, trajectories, ribbons from columns and rows; these should work in both the forward and reverse time sense.
* lat/lon line labels
* lat/lon scales on maps and improved vertical scale.
* add mouse wheel support to Omni control
* rewrite the sounding displays
  ** overlay multiple soundings (e.g. grids and observed)
  ** support for additional stability parameters
  ** pre-select the location for sampling into grids
* Plot upper air station obs at the appropriate level
* Improve color scale and labelling in the displays
* merge contours/color filled contours into one control where the user can select one or both.
* Allow zooming of RHI control without axis changing (use TransectDisplay?)
* Ignore the level dimension in PlanViewControls - allow either using levels or   Z value to place a display
* Show the current timestep in the Time/Height Display
* Observed sounding cross sections and time/height displays
* ensemble model features (displays and diagnostics)
* change "Layout Model" to "Plot Model"
* In FlowXControl, change the range widget to be a ValueSelectorWidget
* In CrossSectionControl and VerticalProfileControl, use native vertical dimension instead of Altitude
* allow for formatting time variable in the Layout Model Editor
* calculate radar max composite - or composite through levels in general
* Move from using println to logging in GEMPAK IOSPs
* Allow users to set the Weather Text Product server
* Need to be able to capture the Profiler Displays - needs a ViewManager
* Hodograph needs a display list label
* support multiple parameter data transects
* progressive disclosure of wind barbs.
* allow user to set timezone on the %time:% macro in the display controls
* update to Jython 2.5 to support JNumeric
* adjust size of contour labels - need to implement label size in ContourInfo.  Should probably be done in conjunction with SSEC to support fonts for contour labels.
* Add a circle shape and other shapes to the drawing control

===Data===

* improved time selection - select data based on existing displays (e.g. reference dataset).  Needs to work in bundles
* auto subset of data (images/grids) based on the current projection
* support for alternative vertical coordinates (e.g. theta, sigma, etc)
* text grid import (e.g., Surfer format, GEON)
* TIGGE Tropical Cyclone (CXML) products (https://dss.ucar.edu/datazone/dsszone/ds330.3/)
* Web Map Server Time requests
* Save NEXRAD/TDS data in a bundle
* Watches/Warnings
* create an extractLongitude method (akin to extractLatitude)
* CF exporting - include lat/lon to be complete
* CF exporting - handle cross section output
* Support for grids with multiple projections (e.g. McIDAS).  This would be a major rewrite of the GeoGridDataSource to handle this in the properties.
* subset across the grid boundary for global grids (needs to be supported in CDM first).
* support for ideal WRF runs (without lat/lon info)
* additional GEMPAK grid diagnostics
* support calculations on point data
* streamlines in cross sections
* vector components normal to a cross section
* if the FMRC is configurable, implement this in the IDV models catalog.  Only show best and constant forecast hour.
* maintain the model run/forecast hour information instead of just the valid time.  Use that in the display labels.

===System===

* memory configuration ala Mc-V.  Write preference to a file, read in runIDV.bat  and runIDV.
* Check for updates.
* memory improvements (image caching, imageByRef)

===Other===

* Rewrite the Projection Manager
* Improve color bars in PDF
* improve export to vector graphics - right now it only shows what's displayed so you get screen resolution

- loading stations when zoomed has scaling issues (Jeff)
