To make the Rico installers simply source the script:
source makeInstaller.sh

By default this script runs the makeia.tcl script with
the source tree root being this directory tree. The destination
is also this directory.

When IA first comes up you need to select the project file to use.
Select "Open Existing Project"

If IA has been run before past project files will be listed.
Note: This lists all project files  that have been used by 
*all* users. Its best to select: "Open Other" and explicitly
select the one to use, which is:
ucar/unidata/apps/rico/scratch/generated_rico_1_0.iap_xml



Once you select a project file just keep hitting "Next"



When a dialog pops up asking  you to specify a main class just hit No.

Finally hit "Build"

When its done hit exit. The makeia.tcl script will now make the d3d windows
installer. Repeat the above.

When done all of the installers will be placed in this directory.
