Make a set of pre-defined projections

See what it takes to have a real-time and a non-real-time
trex plugin jar.

Any more map shape files than inyoroads.shp

Station model editor - string pattern -> shape

Special choosers like in RICO?

Change sounding data source  to support directory/pattern based specification
of the files.

What display controls need to be changed to behave differently in the context
of the new XSVM

Contour vertical XS - cannot add in its own XS selector. Needs to get XS change events
from the XSVM

Figure out how to handle the new type of VM in the VMManager. Do some controls
only show up in one type of VM?



Data
-----------
Catalog data on a http server?

Latest directory - We should have a "latest" or "today" symbolic directory link 
that points to the current actual directory. This way we can create bundles for the 
real-time data.


Aircract netcdf file - We are assuming that  all of the aircraft track data for one 
flight will be in one netcdf format.  Assuming RAF netcdf format.
How many fields will there be in the real-time Hiaper track data. All or a subset.


Will we be getting satellite images from the LDM and putting them on disk.
Will we need to do handle real-time satellite imagery by polling and reloading
the data. If so, ImageDataSource needs some work to handle this.
