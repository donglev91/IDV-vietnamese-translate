Bugs:


UI Issues:

- parm name in data probe for level III is not good

- y axis label in time series of level III says "image display"

- include sweep angle in Level II time series labels

- Mark color tables as not visible

- Allow user to set date format



New Development:

  Datasources/Data selection:

    - Create a mapping of server names to human readable locations
      (ie adde.ucar.edu -> NCAR Community Data Portal) for ADDE choosers.

    - Better breakdown between ADDE servers and the data they serve
      up.
      
    - Shuffle ADDE servers to balance the load
      
    - AWIPS grids do not use correct Unit specs.  Need a mechanism
      for users to create a list of units vs. correct names. Use
      alias mechanism?
    
    - I load up Level II data and the times are: 15:54:30, 16:04:16
      I then load in level III data and the times are a bit off:
      15:54:00,16:04:00 I assume this is just a side effect of the processing
      but it throws off doing image comparisons.  Problem is that
      ADDE images round off to :00 seconds.
    
    - data source sniffer/netCDF file sniffer
    
    - ATD radar, sounding and aircraft data from DODS server
    
    - when adding in multiple files, if an error occurs, accumulate
      the errors and continue loading in all valid datasources.
    
    - Full support for GeoTIFF
    



    - support for multibanded images
    
    - support for isentropic coordinates
    
    - add access to historical point data
    
    - read and display lightning data from ADDE servers
    
    - read and display hurricane position data

    - read and display frontal positions.

    - read GeoTIFF from WCS server.
    
    - tropopause pressure colored by trop temp as topography

    - Support for GEMPAK data (grid, point) from local file and/or
      ADDE server.

    - read in GEMPAK maps

    - read WRF data

    - decode/plot watch/warning boxes.  Maybe use GEMPAK files since gempak
      already has the decoder?

  DisplayControls:

    - change default orientation of cross section selector to N/S instead
      of E/W?

      -When the center mouse button is pressed over a Weather Radar Image the value at that point is noted (dBZ, vel, spectrum width). It would be useful if the beam center height was also returned.

    - Color bar in display for displays with COLORTABLE attribute.

    - In-display labels for better output.

    - lat/long labels in MapDisplayControl

    - Lagrangian display control for plotting values (hurricane
      positions, etc) at points through time.

    - Allow local sharing of all properties between controls.  Use case:
      I load in cross sections of el Nino, la Nina, normal temperature.
      The color table, the range and the contour info all need to be
      shared so I don't have to go through the same motions for each
      one.   Along with this, it might be better to to allow broadcast
      properties - i.e., set up one the way you like it, turn on
      sharing and then broadcast from the first.  The current share
      system only reponds to changes.
    
    - RHI - Do we want to allow the user to change the scale of the XS
      display? I know you can zoom to get better details of the data but you
      also zoom in the scale and get huge scale labels.
    
    - "Levels" in plan view display control are in units mb when using
      entry box; but shift to meters (with 11 decimal points) if you use the
      in-display selector point. Ought to be consistent and use one unit
      or the other. At least the meters ought to be formatted to 4 places
      precision.
    
    - Add ability to add more parameters to a Data cross section display; 
      consider overlay or stacking separate data cross section graphs 
      vertically with same space axis.  ditto for time series plot, 
      profile display, cross sections.
          
    - Better window handling. Do we want an example idv that shows the
      display controls together in a control window? (instead of in individual
      windows). Alternatives to the legend
    
    - customizable readouts
    
    - keep DisplayControls with displays "on top".
    
    - For display controls whose gui is embedded in the html when we 
      do a Show properties from the legend we get an empty window. 
      We probably need to not have the properties entry in the menu.
    
    - clean up RangeAndBearingControl code.  Lots of convolutions on
      setting enpoints.
    

    - clean up Profiler chooser/Display controls code.  Lots of convolutions.
    

    SkewT-
      - allow changing of color of points in SkewT control
      - support modification of contours (spacing, etc) in display
      - rubber band box for display.

    - allow users to change the vertical range of the display controls like
      cross sections, profiles, time/height, etc.
      

  ViewManagers:

    - some click- key combination to recenter display under click
    

  Formulas:

    - Allow user to do spatial derivatives

    - add vector operations, and differential calculus operators del dot,
      and del cross and others as needed.

    - permit use of position coordinates altitude, pressure, latitude
      and longitude as parameters in formulas, for expressions like dT/dp.

    - add wrappers for GridUtil and DerivedGridFactory methods

    - allow categorization of Jython library procdures

  Radar data/displays:

    - Level II data reading needs to be profiled for efficiency, reduce 
      memory usage for Level II data.
    
    - need a dis/az indication for data probe and time series on radar plots
    
    - New radar features:
       - add cursor readout of position as distance and azimuth from the
         center to the probe control (and I suppose the time series control)
       - run WATADS locally and see what we are missing
       - provide a VAD display

       - provide a list of county maps (one for each radar) so don't have to 
         plot all US counties; plotting counties he says is essential.
         AWIPS may have such map files in shapefiles already, per office.
	jeffmc: we need a mapping from nexrad site to county name
	and provide a catalog that gets the county map from conan. 
	
      
    - We might investigate algorithms commonly used to merge adjacent radars
      into a mosaic.
          
    - get and toggle individual beams in the RHI

    - use data to get angles, not VCP hardcoded values
    
    - add a unit combobox for the RadarGridControl items

  Resource Editors:

    Color Table Editor:
      - an alternate topographic color table with the same colors but
        progressively darker towards low values of elevation would show details
        well (more contrast).

    Jython Editor:
      - The jython editor has a set of tabs for each resource. Only     
        the resource in the first tab is editable though there may be     
        other resources in the list that are editable (e.g., if you       
        have other libraries in your user directory). These should be     
        editable. In general the "editable resource" functionality in the 
        ResourceCollection is a hack. I simply use the first resource in  
        the list as the editable one. I really should have a call like:   
        ResourceCollection.isEditable (int resourceIndex);                

    Alias Editor:
      - Allow aliases to use regular expressions
    
  Misc:

    - Need an "undo" option from the Edit menu in case you accidently 
      remove the wrong control from the long list of controls.
    
    - Implement a scheduler (suggestion by Tom W):
    
      The problem: how to implement a 'scheduler' to perform async activities
          
      The solution: provide an interface that can be called from Jython, that
      looks something like:
      
      public void putToDisplay(String name, Data data, ? display_format, ?
      display_number)
      
      Where display_format indicates one of the optional formats, and
      display_number is just that -- some way to put this into a new or
      existing display.
      
      [Of course we then would want to provide a way of removing a Data item
      from the display, right? And probably a few more, related things...this
      could go to "control everything" but I think we need to keep it reined
      in...]
      
      Why would I ever suggest such a thing? Well, first off we need some
      way to do "scheduled" tasks, right? I'd like to see this happen first
      through Python, of course. Besides, if we had a method like this,
      we could extend the usability beyond the GUI in a wide variety of
      directions. Heck one could even make a Command Line Interface ...
      seriously, though, since I don't know the control flow of the IDV at
      all, is this a really, really tough one...or a piece of cake?
      
    - allow layering of data.  
    
    - 2D data is always placed at the bottom of the box and if the 
      box vertical range is below ground, it's confusing.  
    
    - UTM coordinate system - can we convert from one zone to another?
    
    - Performance issues-
      - make sure data isn't be rendered unnecessarily
      - make sure VisAD controls aren't doing unnecessary work (i.e.
        changing controls twice).
    
    - investigate VisAD resolution switching code
    
    - Better animation control - when to update, user ability to
      set time steps.  
    
    - Persist the time step in an animation loop?
    
    - objective analysis of point values
    
    - bug, feature and support tracking system.
    
    - rework projection manager dialog.  Enhancements might include:
       - using OGC names
       - allow user to specify bounds of lat/lon projection
       - allow user to define bounding box for any projection through
         the UI.

    - allow user to change the lighting of displays.

    - tracers/trajectories (ala Vis5D)

Documentation:

UserGuide:

- list of approved unit names for users to refer to

- improve web site
  - framework for examples with images/bundles
  - tips

- a page on allowable operators in the formula editor.  Also maybe
  some more on allowable Jython operators.

- Enhance section on local customization covering the various resources.


Workshop:

- Color table workshop page (6.1) needs a new screendump.  Label
  is not italicized in existing one.

- popup menu on Color Table breakpoint needs new image.  (shows
  the popup for the table, not a breakpoint)


Programmer's Ref:

- update/expand programmer's guide.


Misc:

- need more new help tip dialogs

- add javadoc to all classes/methods.




Collabortion:
- Collaboration in workshop did not work for all connecting to one
  with no relay changes.

- Collaboration chat should have user/machine name.  In a classroom
  setting, typically all clients will have the same user name.

- Handle local datasets in the collaboration environment.

- allow groups of users in collaboration mode.
