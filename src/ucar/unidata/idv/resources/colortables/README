To make the system colortables.xml you run the ColorTableManager, passing
as command line arguments the extra.xml and workshop.xml  file:
java ucar.unidata.ui.colortable.ColorTableManager extra.xml

This  will create the programmatically created color tables and then merge in
the ones given on the command line.

The extra.xml holds the two transparent colortables from the workshop and
the pressure msl.


If you create some new color tables and want to include them you can merge them into
the extra.xml by going:
java ucar.unidata.ui.colortable.ColorTableManager -merge extra.xml yourcolortable.xml
